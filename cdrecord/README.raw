Tips for MMC RAW mode writing.

	This allows to do disk at once recording on Philips drives that
	do not support SAO.

	You may write audio tracks in RAW mode. There are some new
	and most likely transient options:

	-raw16		Write 2352 Bytes sectors + P+Q Subchannel

	-raw96r		Write 2352 Bytes sectors + P+W Subchannel (R-W in raw mode)

	-raw96p		Write 2352 Bytes sectors + P+W Subchannel (R-W in packed mode)

	NOTE that the MMC standard does not allow -dummy in RAW mode.
	There may be drives which allow it but don't bother if it does not work.

	Indices are fully supported in RAW mode.

	MCN & ISRC are not yet supported in RAW mode, they are silently discarded.

	If you find other problems in RAW mode or if you find
	new bugs introduced in old write modes, please send a bug report.

	Cdrecord now checks the properties of the writer. If a specific write
	mode is not supported by the writer, cdrecord warns you and makes
	a suggestion for a similar alternate write mode.

	With the curent structure of cdrecord, it is not possible to silently
	e.g. change the write mode from -dao to -raw96r

	MMC compliant drives are automatically scanned for supported write modes.
	This should help to make cdrecord work without manual static configuration.
	My hope is still to have no need to know all drive properties in 
	advance, so new drives will continue to work as long as they
	are standard compliant enough for cdrecord.

EXAMPLES:

	cdrecord dev=1,0 -v -raw96r *.wav

	will write a audio CD in raw mode using (computed) 2448 byte sectors 
	with raw P-W subchannels. This works e.g. with Plextor drives.


	cdrecord dev=1,0 -v -raw16 *.wav

	will write a audio CD in raw mode using (computed) 2368 byte sectors 
	with raw P+Q subchannels. This works e.g. with Philips drives.


	NOTE: The input sector size always is 2352 bytes for audio.

IMPORTANT:

	-	if the drive supports RAW/R96R among with other raw write modes,
		use -raw96r

	-	if the drive does _only_ supports RAW/R16, use -raw16

	-	... else if the drive supports RAW/R96P, use -raw96p

		The packed raw mode (RAW/R96P) is buggy in Plextor drives and
		the RAW/R16 mode is buggy in TEAC drives. Plextor creates
		unreadable disks and TEAC hangs the drive.

		For this reason, it is important to select the raw writing
		mode accoding to the notes above.
