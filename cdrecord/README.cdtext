CD-Text Usage (to copy CD-Text from master CD):

	cdda2wav -D 6,0 -vall -B	# To extract audio information
	cdrecord dev=6,0 -vv -toc	# To extract CD-Text information

	and then

	cdrecord dev=6,0 -v -dao textfile=cdtext.dat -useinfo *.wav
	or
	cdrecord dev=6,0 -v -raw96r textfile=cdtext.dat -useinfo *.wav

	If the CD-Text information contains more CRC errors than
	cdrecord can correct, you need to reload the CD and to
	re-read the CD-Text information from the master disk.

	Writing of CD-Text is supported for all drives that support
	CD-Text in SAO write mode and for all drives that support
	to write in RAW/RAW96R mode (use -raw96r in this case).

	NOTE: not all writers that support MMC SAO mode support
		to write CD-Text in this write mode.
		If you have a drive that does not support CD-Text
		but supports RAW/RAW96R mode use this mode as
		in RAW/RAW96R mode the drive does not need to know
		about CD-Text. This way even old drives like the
		Plextor PX-R 412C will write CD-Text.

	NOTE that cdda2wav will read CD-Text and fill in the 
	CD-Text fields in the *.inf files if vou use -vall.

	The new cdda2wav option cddb= allows you to tell cdda2wav to
	retrieve CDDB information from freedb.freedb.org.
	cddb=0 means ask if ambiguous, cddb=1 means take first entry.
	The information in this case is filled into the fields
	in the *.inf files.

Creating a CD with CD-Text based on CDDB information from freedb.freedb.org:

	Tell cdda2wav to fetch data from freedb.freedb.org, call

	cdda2wav -D 6,0 -vall -B cddb=1	# To extract audio information/fetch CDDB data

	and then call

	cdrecord dev=6,0 -v -dao -text -useinfo *.wav
	or
	cdrecord dev=6,0 -v -raw96r -text -useinfo *.wav


If you like to create your own CD-text data for a CD use the
following method:

	First extract all tracks with cdda2wav -vall (see above),

	then edit the *.inf Files and add album and song titles.

	Now call cdrecord as if the *.inf files contain CD-Text 
	information.

	Note that it is recommended to use less that 160 characters
	for a single string.
