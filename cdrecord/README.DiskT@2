New driveropts= option "tattoofile=". Use together with -checkdrive 
to write an image of the right size to disk.

	DiskT@2 hints:

	In order to have "DISKTATTOO" listed in the "Driver flags",
	the disk currently inserted must be usable for the DiskT@2 feature.
	This means that there needs to be enough space on it.

	You need an B&W image with 3744 pixels per line

	Best start with a 3744 x 320 pixel image.
	The correct size may be retrieved with
		cdrecord driveropts=tattooinfo -checkdrive

	To get RAW image data:

	-	Take 'xv' and save the image in PBM/PGM/PPM (raw) mode

	-	use a binary aware (must support unlimited linelength)
		editor such as 'ved' and remove the header lines.
		These lines look like:

		P5
		# CREATOR: XV Version 3.10a  Rev: 12/29/94 (PNG patch 1.2)
		# CREATOR: XV Version 3.10a  Rev: 12/29/94 (PNG patch 1.2)
		3744 144
		255

		Now you should have (in case of the file above) a file that
		has exactly 539136 Bytes.

	-	Note that the tattoo image must be left to right flipped
		(a mirror image).

From a hint from "E. Robert Bogusta" <rob23@tmr.com>: 

Take an image, and do:

  djpeg myface.jpg | ppmtopgm | pnmflip -lr | 
    pnmscale -xsi 3744 -ysi 320 | sed '1,/255/d' >myface.tattoo 
 
So: 
  djpeg extracts ppm from a jpeg. Use your favorite other way of getting 
this far is you wish. 
 
  ppmtopgm changes color to grey scale 
 
  pnmflip -lr flips left to right, the small image is faster 
 
  pnmscale makes it 3644x320 regardless of starting size. This may make it 
look really odd on the CD if it doesn't start off the right size. More on 
this after I try it. 
 
  sed strips from the first line to the line containing 255, which is the 
last header line. 
 
Note that it would be better to use the actual height of the applicable image instead
of the maximum value of 320 and it would be even more correct to create an
image that has the right width/height ratio for the target on CD in order
get an undistorted view of the image on CD.

For best visibility, use black text on light background.
