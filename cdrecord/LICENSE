# @(#)LIMITATIONS	1.3 09/04/10 Copyright 2002-2007 J. Schilling

This software is under CDDL but you should read the following clarifications:


-	You may not modify certain copyright messages in cdrecord.c

	See cdrecord.c for further information.


-	You may (with a few exceptions) not modify the location of the
	configuration file /etc/default/cdrecord.

	See defaults.c for further information.

The Author does encourage you to make changes in consent with him.
Since this if free software, you are of course free to make any
modifications you seem fit. However, if you choose to do this,
the restrictions (see below) apply.

Note that the fact that the Author is disallowing you to change things that
affect global compatibility and the fact that you are required to warn people
in case you did use an unapproved build system is not in violation with

	http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php
or
	http://www.debian.org/social_contract

as you are still allowed to make any changes you like in case you:

-	clearly document that you don't care about compatibility (e.g. identical
	behavior on all supported platforms) or quality (in case you use an
	unaproved build system)

-	clearly document that you did create a globally incompatible version

-	clearly document that you document your reasons and the background for
	the modifications you did make

-	clearly also inform all users about the official behavior of the
	original version of the program and avoid to confuse users with
	spreading usage information that does not add a hint that this
	information does not apply to the original version.

In case that you create a variant of cdrecord that is too different from the
original, you should think about using a different name. Note that as e.g.
many people use the name "dvdrecord" when talking about the DVD-enabled 
origional version of cdrecord. For this reason, I believe that "dvdrecord"
is a too similar name.

In case that you change the behavior of the dev= option on a platform that
is already supported by the files in the original source distribution,
this is considered to be a significant deviation. You need to change the name
for such a variant.

Note that you need to distribute this file together with the sources
in case you publish the original version or modified variants.
