CD-R drives are anything but WORM drives, but older drives identify themselves
as WORM drives.
A Worm drive is able to write each sector once at any time without preparation.
A CD-R drives is not and never will be able to do this.
However some old drives identify as WORM drives.

For this reason the SCSI-3 standard tells CD-R drives simply CD drives
with multi media extensions.
