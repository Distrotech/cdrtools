     CCddrreeccoorrdd is used to record data or audio Compact Discs on an
     Orange  Book  CD-recorder,  to  write  DVD  media  on a DVD-
     recorder or to write BluRay media on a BluRay-recorder.

     Most users do not need to care about device naming  at  all.
     If  no  ddeevv==  option was specified, ccddrreeccoorrdd implements aauuttoo
     ttaarrggeett support and automagically finds  the  drive  in  case
     that  exactly one CD-ROM type drive is available in the sys-
     tem.  In case that more than one CD-ROM type drive exists on
     the system, a list of possible device name parameters may be
     retrieved with ccddrreeccoorrdd -ssccaannbbuuss or from the target  example
     from  the output of ccddrreeccoorrdd ddeevv==hheellpp, then the ddeevv== parame-
     ter may be set based on the device listing.

     The _d_e_v_i_c_e parameter to  the  ddeevv==  option  explained  below
     refers  to _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n of the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder.
     If a file /etc/default/cdrecord exists, the parameter to the
     ddeevv== option may also be a drive name label in said file (see
     FILES section).

     On SSVVrr44 compliant systems, ccddrreeccoorrdd uses the real-time class
     to  get  the  highest  scheduling  priority that is possible
     (higher than all kernel processes).  On systems  with  PPOOSSIIXX
     rreeaall--ttiimmee sscchheedduulliinngg cdrecord uses real-time scheduling too,
     but may not be able to gain a priority that is  higher  than
     all kernel processes.

     In order to be able to use the SCSI transport  subsystem  of
     the  OS,  run  at highest priority and lock itself into core
     ccddrreeccoorrdd either needs  to  be  run  as  root,  needs  to  be
     installed  suid  root  or  must  be  called via RRBBAACCss pfexec
     mechanism.

     file that contains the prepared data for that track.  If the
     argument is `-', standard input is used for that track. Only
     one  track  may  be  taken  from  _s_t_d_i_n.  In the other write

     implemented.   In  -cclloonnee  mode,  a single file contains all
     data for the whole disk.  To allow DVD writing on  platforms
     that do not implement large file support, ccddrreeccoorrdd concaten-
     ates all file arguments to a single track  when  writing  to
     DVD media.

     -dduummmmyy
          The -dduummmmyy option modifies the current write  strategy.
          The CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder will go through all steps of
          the recording process, but the laser is turned off dur-
          ing  this  procedure.  It is recommended to run several
          tests before actually writing  to  a  Compact  Disk  or
          Digital Versatile Disk, if the timing and load response
          of the current system is not yet known.

          The -dduummmmyy option does not  work  with  all  media  and
          write modes.  DVD+ media and BluRay media does not sup-
          port dduummmmyy writes and most CD-recorders do not  support
          dduummmmyy writes in raw mode.

     -mmuullttii
          Allow multi-session CDs  or  multi-border  DVDs  to  be
          made.  This flag needs to be present on all sessions of
          a multi-session or multi-border disk, except  you  want
          to  create a session on a CD that will be the last ses-
          sion on the CD-media.

          For CD-media, the fixation will be done in a  way  that
          allows  the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder to append additional
          sessions later. This is done by generating a TOC with a
          link  to  the next program area. The so generated media
          is not 100% compatible to manufactured CDs (except  for
          CDplus).  Use  only for recording of multi-session CDs.

          option  in order to create multi-session disks on these
          drives.  If you like to record a multi-session disk  in
          SAO mode, you need to force CCDD--RROOMM sectors by including
          the -ddaattaa option.  Not all drives  allow  multi-session
          CDs in SAO mode.

          DDiisskk  AAtt OOnnccee mode.  This currently only works with MMC
          drives that support SSeessssiioonn AAtt OOnnccee  mode.   Note  that
          cdrecord  needs  to  know  the  size  of  each track in

          with  subchannel  content  (e.g.  wrong  times  on  the

          write  in  -rraaww9966rr or -rraaww1166 mode, you should give it a

          size of 2448 bytes.  This is the preferred raw  writing
          mode  as it gives best control over the CD-writing pro-
          cess.  Writing data disks in raw  mode  needs  signifi-
          cantly  more  CPU  time than other write modes. If your
          CPU is too slow, this may result in  buffer  underruns.

          sector size of 2448 bytes.  This is the less  preferred
          raw writing mode as only a few recorders support it and
          some of these  recorders  have  bugs  in  the  firmware
          implementation.   Don't  use this mode if your recorder
          supports -rraaww9966rr or -rraaww1166.  Writing data disks in  raw
          mode needs significantly more CPU time than other write

          CD/DVD/BluRay re-writable  media.   With  this  option,
          ccddrreeccoorrdd  will  try  to  retrieve the ATIP info. If the
          actual drive does not support to read the ATIP info, it
          may  be  that only a reduced set of information records
          or even nothing is displayed. Only a limited number  of
          MMC-compliant drives support to read the ATIP info.

          If ccddrreeccoorrdd is able to retrieve the lead-in start  time
          for  the first session, it will try to decode and print
          the manufacturer info from the media.  DVD  media  does
          not  have  ATIP  information  but  there  is equivalent
          prerecorded information that is read out and printed.

          all         Blank the entire disk. This may take a long
                      time.

          fast        Minimally blank the disk. This  results  in
                      erasing the PMA, the TOC and the pregap.

          Not all drives support all blanking types.  It  may  be
          necessary  to use bbllaannkk==aallll if a drive reports a speci-
          fied command as being invalid.  If used  together  with
          the -ffoorrccee flag, this option may be used to blank CD-RW
          disks that otherwise cannot be blanked. Note  that  you
          may  need to specify bbllaannkk==_a_l_l because some drives will
          not continue with certain types  of  bad  CD-RW  disks.
          Note  also  that  ccddrreeccoorrdd  does its best if the -ffoorrccee
          flag is used but it  finally  depends  on  the  drive's
          firmware whether the blanking operation will succeed or
          not.

          Note that copying in cclloonnee mode disables certain levels

          track number 1.  This option currently only makes sense
          with the TEAC drive when creating  track-at-once  disks
          without the 2-second silence before each track.
          This option may go away in the future.

     ddrriivveerr==_n_a_m_e
          Allows the user to manually select  a  driver  for  the
          device.    The   reason   for   the  existence  of  the
          ddrriivveerr==_n_a_m_e option is to allow users  to  use  ccddrreeccoorrdd
          with  drives  that  are similar to supported drives but
          not known directly by ccddrreeccoorrdd.  All drives made  after
          1997  should  be  MMC-standard-compliant  and thus sup-
          ported by one of the MMC drivers.  It is most  unlikely
          that  ccddrreeccoorrdd  is  unable  to  find  the  right driver
          automatically.  Use this option with extreme care. If a
          wrong  driver  is used for a device, the possibility of
          creating corrupted disks is high.  The minimum  problem
          related  to a wrong driver is that the -ssppeeeedd or -dduummmmyy
          will not work.

          The following driver names are supported:

          hheellpp To get a list of possible drivers together with  a
               short description.

          mmmmcc__bbdd
               The generic  SCSI-3/mmc  BluRay  driver  is  auto-
               selected  whenever ccddrreeccoorrdd finds an MMC-compliant
               drive that does support to write BluRay media or a
               multi  system  that  contains a BluRay disk as the
               current medium.  This driver tries  to  close  the
               tray, checks the medium found in the tray and then
               branches to the driver that  matches  the  current
               medium.

          mmmmcc__bbddrr
               The generic  SCSI-3/mmc  BluRay  driver  is  auto-
               selected  whenever ccddrreeccoorrdd finds an MMC-compliant
               drive that does support to write BluRay BD-R media
               or a multi system that contains a BluRay BD-R disk
               as the current medium.

          mmmmcc__bbddrree
               The generic  SCSI-3/mmc  BluRay  driver  is  auto-
               selected  whenever ccddrreeccoorrdd finds an MMC-compliant
               drive that does  support  to  write  BluRay  BD-RE
               media  or  a  multi  system that contains a BluRay
               BD-RE disk as the current medium.

          mmmmcc__ccdd
               The generic  SCSI-3/mmc  CD-ROM  driver  is  auto-
               selected  whenever ccddrreeccoorrdd finds an MMC-compliant
               drive that does not  identify  itself  to  support
               writing at all, or that only identifies to support
               media or write modes not implemented in ccddrreeccoorrdd.

          mmmmcc__ccdd__ddvvdd
               The generic  SCSI-3/mmc  CD/DVD/BluRay  driver  is
               auto-selected  whenever ccddrreeccoorrdd finds an MMC-2 or
               MMC-3-compliant drive that seems to  support  more
               than  one  medium  type and the tray is open or no
               medium could be found to select the right  driver.
               This  driver  tries  to close the tray, checks the
               medium found in the tray and then branches to  the
               driver that matches the current medium.

          mmmmcc__ccddrr
               The generic SCSI-3/mmc CD-R/CD-RW driver is  auto-
               selected  whenever ccddrreeccoorrdd finds an MMC-compliant
               drive that only supports to write CDs or  a  multi
               system  drive  that  contains  a CD as the current
               medium.

          mmmmcc__ccddrr__ssoonnyy
               The generic SCSI-3/mmc CD-R/CD-RW driver is  auto-
               selected  whenever ccddrreeccoorrdd would otherwise select
               the mmmmcc__ccddrr driver but the device seems to be made
               by  Sony.   The  mmmmcc__ccddrr__ssoonnyy is definitely needed
               for the Sony CDU 928 as this drive does  not  com-
               pletely implement the MMC standard and some of the
               MMC SCSI commands have  to  be  replaced  by  Sony
               proprietary  commands.  It  seems  that  all  Sony
               drives (even newer ones) still implement the  Sony
               proprietary SCSI commands so it has not yet become
               a problem to use this driver for all Sony  drives.
               If  you find a newer Sony drive that does not work
               with this driver, please report.

          mmmmcc__ddvvdd
               The generic SCSI-3/mmc-2  DVD-R/DVD-RW  driver  is
               auto-selected  whenever ccddrreeccoorrdd finds an MMC-2 or
               MMC-3-compliant drive that supports to write  DVDs
               and  an appropriate medium is loaded.  There is no
               Track At Once mode for DVD writers.

          mmmmcc__ddvvddpplluuss
               The generic SCSI-3/mmc-3  DVD+R/DVD+RW  driver  is
               auto-selected whenever one of the DVD+ media types
               that are incompatible to each other is found.   It
               checks  media and then branches to the driver that
               matches the current medium.

          mmmmcc__ddvvddpplluussrr
               The generic SCSI-3/mmc-3  DVD+R  driver  is  auto-
               selected  whenever  a  DVD+R medium is found in an
               appropriate writer.  Note that for unknown reason,
               the  DVD+RW Alliance does not like that there is a
               simulation mode for DVD+R media.   The  author  of
               ccddrreeccoorrdd tries to convince manufacturers to imple-
               ment a simulation mode  for  DVD+R  and  implement
               support.   DVD+R only supports one write mode that
               is somewhere between  Track  At  Once  and  Packet
               writing; this mode is selected in ccddrreeccoorrdd via the
               -ddaaoo/-ssaaoo option.

          mmmmcc__ddvvddpplluussrrww
               The generic SCSI-3/mmc-3 DVD+RW  driver  is  auto-
               selected  whenever  a DVD+RW medium is found in an
               appropriate writer.  As DVD+RW media  need  to  be
               formatted  before  their first use, cdrecord auto-
               detects this medium state and  performs  a  format
               before  it starts to write.  Note that for unknown
               reason, the DVD+RW Alliance  does  not  like  that
               there  is  a  simulation  mode  nor a way to erase
               DVD+RW media.  DVD+RW only supports one write mode

               The driver  for  Matsushita/Panasonic  CW-7501  is
               auto-selected when ccddrreeccoorrdd finds this old pre-MMC
               drive.  CCddrreeccoorrdd supports all write modes for this
               drive type.

          kkooddaakk__ppccdd__660000
               The driver for Kodak PCD-600 is auto-selected when
               ccddrreeccoorrdd  finds  this  old pre-MMC drive which has
               been the first high speed  (6x)  CD-writer  for  a
               long  time.  This  drive  behaves similarly to the
               Philips CDD-521 drive.

          pphhiilliippss__ccdddd552211
               The driver for Philips  CDD-521  is  auto-selected
               when ccddrreeccoorrdd finds a Philips CDD-521 drive (which
               is the first CD-writer ever made) or  one  of  the
               other drives that are known to behave similarly to
               this drive.  All Philips CDD-521 or similar drives
               (see  other  drivers  in this list) do not support
               Session At Once recording.

               with very old firmware which has some known  limi-
               tations.

               The driver for Philips  CDD-522  is  auto-selected
               when ccddrreeccoorrdd finds a Philips CDD-522 which is the
               successor of the 521 or one of its  variants  with
               Kodak label.  CCddrreeccoorrdd does not support Session At
               Once recording with these drives.

               The driver for Philips  CDD-521  with  pessimistic
               assumptions  is  never  auto-selected.   It may be
               used by hand with drives that behave similarly  to
               the Philips CDD-521.

               not support writing or a pre-MMC  writer  that  is
               not supported by ccddrreeccoorrdd.

               XR-W2010, Pinnacle RCD-5020 is auto-selected when-
               ever one of the drives is found that is  known  to
               use  the non-MMC command set used by TEAC and JVC.
               Note that many  drives  from  JVC  will  not  work
               because  they do not correctly implement the docu-
               mented command set and JVC has been  unwilling  to

               and  speed  tests  with  parameters that match the
               behavior of CD-writers.

          ddvvdd__ssiimmuull
               The simulation DVD-R driver allows to  run  timing
               and  speed  tests  with  parameters that match the
               behavior of DVD writers.

          There are two  special  driver  entries  in  the  list:
          ccddrr__ssiimmuull  and  ddvvdd__ssiimmuull.   These  driver  entries are
          designed to make timing tests at any  speed  or  timing
          tests for drives that do not support the -dduummmmyy option.
          The simulation drivers implement a drive with a  buffer
          size   of   1 MB   that   can   be   changed   via  the
          CCDDRR__SSIIMMUULL__BBUUFFSSIIZZEE environment variable.  The simulation
          driver  correctly simulates even a buffer underrun con-
          dition.  If the -dduummmmyy option is present,  the  simula-
          tion is not aborted in case of a buffer underrun.

     ddrriivveerrooppttss==_o_p_t_i_o_n _l_i_s_t
          Set driver specific options. The options are  specified
          as  a  comma  separated  list.   To get a list of valid
          options use ddrriivveerrooppttss==_h_e_l_p together with  the  -_c_h_e_c_k_-
          _d_r_i_v_e  option.   If  you  like  to  set  driver options
          without running a typical ccddrreeccoorrdd task,  you  need  to
          use  the  -sseettddrrooppttss  option in addition, otherwise the
          command  line  parser  in   ccddrreeccoorrdd   will   complain.
          Currently implemented driver options are:

               on.   This  only  works  for  drives  that support
               Buffer Underrun  Free  technology.   This  may  be
               called:  SSaannyyoo BBUURRNN--PPrrooooff, RRiiccoohh JJuusstt--LLiinnkk, YYaammaahhaa

               feature. If values > 1.0 are used, then  the  disk
               capacity is increased.

               Not all drives support all GGiiggaaRReecc values.  When a
               drive uses the GGiiggaaRReecc feature, the write speed is
               limited to 8x.

               which  usually  should  result in high quality CDs
               that have less reading problems in Hi-Fi  players.
               As this is implemented as a variant of the Session
               At Once write mode,  it  will  only  work  if  you
               select SAO write mode and there is no need to turn
               it off.  The AAuuddiioo MMaasstteerr mode will  work  with  a
               limited  speed but may also be used with data CDs.
               In AAuuddiioo MMaasstteerr mode, the pits on the CD  will  be
               written  larger  than usual so the capacity of the
               medium is reduced when turning this feature on.  A
               74-minute  CD  will  only  have  a  capacity of 63
               minutes if AAuuddiioo MMaasstteerr is active and the capacity
               of  a  80-minute CD will be reduced to 68 minutes,
               the capacity in will be reduced to 85% of the ori-
               ginal  capacity.   On  newer  Plextor drives, this
               feature is also present but the capacity  will  be
               reduced  to  86.66%  of the original capacity. For
               other factors on Plextor drives, see  the  ggiiggaarreecc

               Normally, modern drives know the highest  possible
               speed for different media and may reduce the speed
               in order to grant best write quality.  This  tech-
               nology  may  be  called:   PPlleexxttoorr PPoowweerrRReecc, RRiiccoohh

               similar.   Some  drives  (e.g.  Plextor, Ricoh and
               Yamaha) allow  to  force  the  drive  to  use  the
               selected  speed  even if the medium is so bad that
               the write quality would be poor. This option tells
               such  a  drive  to force to use the selected speed
               regardless of the medium quality.

               Use this option with extreme care  and  note  that
               the  drive  should  know  better which medium will
               work at full speed.  The default is to  turn  ffoorr--
               cceessppeeeedd  off,  regardless  of  the defaults of the

          this  option.   CCddrreeccoorrdd implements several checks that
          prevent you from doing unwanted  things  like  damaging
          CD-RW  media  by  improper  drives.  Many of the sanity
          checks are disabled when the -ffoorrccee option is used.

          This option also implements some tricks that will allow
          you to blank bad CD-RW disks.

     -ffoorrmmaatt
          Format a CD-RW/DVD-RW/DVD+RW/BD-RE disc.  Formatting is
          currently  only implemented for DVD+RW and BD-RE media.
          A 'maiden' DVD+RW or BD-RE medium needs to be formatted
          before you may write to it.  However, as ccddrreeccoorrdd auto-
          detects the need for formatting in this case  and  auto
          formats  the medium before it starts writing, the -ffoorr--
          mmaatt option is only  needed  if  you  like  to  forcibly
          reformat a DVD+RW or BD-RE medium.

     ffss==# Set the FIFO (ring buffer) size to #.  You may use  the
          same syntax as in dddd(1), ssdddd(1) or ssttaarr(1).  The number
          representing the size is taken in bytes  unless  other-
          wise  specified.   If  a number is followed directly by
          the letter `b', `k', `m', `s' or `f', the size is  mul-
          tiplied  by 512, 1024, 1024*1024, 2048 or 2352.  If the
          size consists of numbers separated by `x' or `*',  mul-
          tiplication  of  the  two  numbers  is performed.  Thus
          _f_s=_1_0_x_6_3_k will specify a FIFO size of 630 kBytes.

          The size specified by the  _f_s=  argument  includes  the
          shared  memory  that is needed for administration. This
          is at least one page of memory.  If no  _f_s=  option  is
          present,  ccddrreeccoorrdd  will try to get the FIFO size value
          from the CCDDRR__FFIIFFOOSSIIZZEE environment.   The  default  FIFO
          size is currently 4 MB.

          The FIFO is used to increase buffering  for  the  real-
          time  writing  process.   It  allows to run a pipe from
          mmkkiissooffss directly into ccddrreeccoorrdd.  If the FIFO is  active
          and a pipe from mmkkiissooffss into ccddrreeccoorrdd is used to create
          a CD, ccddrreeccoorrdd will abort prior to do any modifications
          on the disk if mmkkiissooffss dies before writing starts.  The
          recommended FIFO size is between 4 and 128 MBytes.   As
          a rule of thumb, the FIFO size should be at least equal
          to  the  size   of   the   internal   buffer   of   the
          CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder  and  no  more  than half of the
          physical amount of RAM available in  the  machine.   If
          the  FIFO  size is big enough, the FIFO statistics will
          print a FIFO empty count of zero and a  FIFO  min  fill
          not  below  20%.   It is not wise to use too much space
          for the FIFO. If you need more than 8 MB to write a  CD
          at  a speed less than 20x from an image on a local file
          system on an  idle  machine,  your  machine  is  either

          underpowered,   has   hardware   problems  or  is  mis-
          configured.  If you like to write DVDs or to write  CDs
          at  higher  speed, it makes sense to use at least 16 MB
          for the FIFO.

          On old and small machines, you need to be more  careful
          with  the  FIFO  size.   If  your machine has less than
          256 MB of physical RAM, you should not set  up  a  FIFO
          size  that  is more than 32 MB.  The sun4c architecture
          (e.g. a Sparcstation-2) has only MMU page table entries
          for  16 MBytes  per  process. Using more than 14 MBytes
          for the FIFO may cause the  operating  system  in  this
          case  to  spend  much time to constantly reload the MMU
          tables. Newer machines from Sun do not  have  this  MMU
          hardware  problem.  The author has no information on PC
          hardware reflecting this problem.

          Old Linux systems for  non-x86  platforms  have  broken
          definitions for the shared memory size. You need to fix
          them and rebuild the kernel or manually  tell  ccddrreeccoorrdd
          to use a smaller FIFO.

          If you have buffer underruns or similar problems  (like
          a  constantly  empty  drive-buffer)  and observe a zero
          _f_i_f_o _e_m_p_t_y  _c_o_u_n_t,  you  have  hardware  problems  that
          prevent the data from flowing fast enough from the ker-
          nel memory to the drive. The FIFO size in this case  is
          sufficient,  but  you  should  check  for a working DMA
          setup.

     ggrraacceettiimmee==#
          Set the grace  time  before  starting  to  write  to  #
          seconds.   Values  below  3  seconds are not allowed in
          order to prevent the volume management from  interrupt-
          ing the write process.

     -iiggnnssiizzee
          Ignore the known size of the medium. This option should
          be used with extreme care, it exists only for debugging
          purposes so do not use it for other reasons.  It is not
          needed  to write disks with more than the nominal capa-
          city.  This option implies -oovveerrbbuurrnn.

          with  ATAPI  hard-disk  and CD/DVD/BluRay writer on the

          (approx. 800 MB).  Setting the -iimmmmeedd flag will request
          the  command  to return immediately while the operation
          proceeds in background, making the bus usable  for  the
          other  devices and avoiding the system freeze.  This is
          an experimental feature which may work or not,  depend-
          ing  on  the  model  of  the  CD/DVD/BluRay  writer.  A
          correct solution would be to set up a  correct  cabling
          but  there  seem  to be notebooks around that have been
          set up the wrong way by the  manufacturer.   As  it  is
          impossible to fix this problem in notebooks, the -iimmmmeedd
          option has been added.

          A second experimental feature of the -iimmmmeedd flag is  to
          tell  cdrecord to try to wait short times while writing
          to the media. This is expected to free the IDE  bus  if
          the  CD/DVD/BluRay  writer and the data source are con-
          nected to  the  same  IDE  cable.  In  this  case,  the
          CD/DVD/BluRay  writer would otherwise usually block the
          IDE bus for nearly all the time making it impossible to
          fetch  data from the source drive. See also the mmiinnbbuuff==
          and -vv options.

          Use both features at your own risk.  If  it  turns  out
          that  it would make sense to have a separate option for
          the wait feature, write to the author and convince him.

     -iinnqq Do an inquiry for the drive, print the inquiry info for
          the drive and exit.

     -llooaadd
          Load the media and exit. This only works with  a  tray-
          loading mechanism but seems to be useful when using the
          Kodak disk transporter.

     -lloocckk
          Load the media, lock the door and exit. This only works
          with  a  tray-loading  mechanism but seems to be useful
          when using the Kodak disk transporter.

     mmccnn==_m_e_d__c_a_t__n_r
          Set the MMeeddiiaa CCaattaalloogg NNuummbbeerr of the CD to _m_e_d__c_a_t__n_r.

     mmiinnbbuuff==_v_a_l_u_e
          The mmiinnbbuuff== option allows to define the minimum  drive-
          buffer  fill ratio for the experimental ATAPI wait mode
          that is intended to free the IDE bus to allow hard disk
          and  CD/DVD/BluRay  writer to be on the same IDE cable.
          As the wait mode currently only works when the  verbose
          option -vv has been specified, ccddrreeccoorrdd implies the ver-
          bose option in case the -iimmmmeedd or  mmiinnbbuuff==  option  has
          been  specified.   Valid values for mmiinnbbuuff== are between
          25 and  95  for  25%...95%  minimum  drive-buffer  fill

          ratio.

     -mmeeddiiaa-iinnffoo

     -mmiinnffoo
          Retrieve and print information about the state  of  the
          medium.   This  option  currently  only  works for MMC-
          compliant drives.

     -mmssiinnffoo
          Retrieve multi-session info  in  a  form  suitable  for
          mmkkiissooffss--11..1100 or later.

          This option makes only sense with a CD that contains at
          least one closed session and is appendable (not finally
          closed yet). Some drives create error messages  if  you
          try  to  get  the multi-session info for a disk that is
          not suitable for this operation.

     -nnoocclloossee
          Do not close the current track,  useful  only  when  in
          packet  writing  mode.   This is an experimental inter-
          face.

     -nnooffiixx
          Do not fixate the disk after writing the  tracks.  This
          may  be  used  to create an audio disk in steps. An un-
          fixated disk can usually not be used on a non CD-writer
          type  drive but there are audio CD-players that will be
          able to play such a disk.

     -oovveerrbbuurrnn
          Allow ccddrreeccoorrdd to write more than the official size  of
          a  medium.  This  feature is usually called _o_v_e_r_b_u_r_n_i_n_g
          and depends on the fact that most blank media may  hold
          more space than the official size. As the official size
          of the lead-out area on the disk is  90  seconds  (6750
          sectors) and a disk usually works if there are at least
          150 sectors of lead out, all media may be overburned by
          at  least 88 seconds (6600 sectors).  Most CD-recorders
          only do overburning in SSAAOO or RRAAWW  mode.  Known  excep-
          tions  are TEAC CD-R50S, TEAC CD-R55S and the Panasonic
          CW-7502.  Some drives do not allow to overburn as  much
          as you might like and limit the size of a CD to e.g. 76
          minutes. This problem may be  circumvented  by  writing
          the  CD  in  RAW mode because this way the drive has no
          chance to find the size before starting to burn.  There
          is no guarantee that your drive supports overburning at
          all.  Make a test to check if your drive implements the
          feature.

          face.

     ppkkttssiizzee==#
          Set the packet size to #,  forces  fixed  packet  mode.
          This is an experimental interface.

     -pprrccaapp
          Print the drive capabilities  for  SCSI-3/mmc-compliant
          drives  as  obtained from mode page 0x2A. Values marked
          with _k_B use 1000 bytes as kilo-byte, values marked with
          _K_B use 1024 bytes as Kilo-byte.

     -sseettddrrooppttss
          Set the driveropts specified by ddrriivveerrooppttss==_o_p_t_i_o_n _l_i_s_t,,
          the  ssppeeeedd  of  the  drive and the dduummmmyy flag and exit.
          This allows cdrecord to set drive  specific  parameters
          that  are not directly used by ccddrreeccoorrdd like e.g.  ssiinn--
          ggllee sseessssiioonn mmooddee, hhiiddee ccddrr and similar.  It  is  needed
          in  case  that  ddrriivveerrooppttss==_o_p_t_i_o_n _l_i_s_t should be called
          without planning to run a typical ccddrreeccoorrdd task.

     ssppeeeedd==#
          Set the speed factor of the writing process to #.  # is
          an  integer,  representing  a multiple of what has been
          defined as single speed for the medium.

          For CD-media, single speed is the audio playback speed.
          This  is  about  150 KB/s for CD-ROM and about 172 KB/s
          for CD-Audio.  Single speed is about 1385 kB/s for  DVD
          media and about 4496 kB/s for BluRay media.

          If no _s_p_e_e_d option is present, ccddrreeccoorrdd will try to get
          a   drive   specific   speed   value   from   the  file
          //eettcc//ddeeffaauulltt//ccddrreeccoorrdd and if it  cannot  find  one,  it
          will  try  to  get  the  speed value from the CCDDRR__SSPPEEEEDD
          environment and later  from  the  CCDDRR__SSPPEEEEDD==  entry  in
          //eettcc//ddeeffaauulltt//ccddrreeccoorrdd.   If  no  speed  value  could be
          found, cdrecord uses a drive  specific  default  speed.
          The  default  for  all new (MMC-compliant) drives is to
          use the maximum supported by the  drive.   If  you  use
          _s_p_e_e_d=_0  with  a  MMC-compliant  drive,  ccddrreeccoorrdd  will
          switch to the  lowest  possible  speed  for  drive  and
          medium.   If  you are using an old (non-MMC) drive that
          has problems with _s_p_e_e_d=_2 or _s_p_e_e_d=_4,  you  should  try
          _s_p_e_e_d=_0.

          Write CD-Text information based  on  information  taken

          text strings.  CCddrreeccoorrdd  supports  CD-Text  information

          from  a  CCUUEE  sshheeeett file.  If a CCUUEE sshheeeett file contains
          both (binary  CDTEXTFILE  and  text  based  SONGWRITER)
          entries,  then  the information based on the CDTEXTFILE
          entry will win.

          You need to use the  -uusseeiinnffoo  option  in  addition  in
          order  to  tell  ccddrreeccoorrdd  to  read  the **..iinnff files or
          ccuueeffiillee==_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e in order to tell ccddrreeccoorrdd  to  read  a
          CCUUEE  sshheeeett file in addition.  If you like to write your
          own CD-Text information, edit the **..iinnff  files  or  the
          CCUUEE sshheeeett file with a text editor and change the fields
          that are relevant for CD-Text.

     tteexxttffiillee==_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
          Write CD-Text based on information found in the  binary
          file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  This file must contain information in a
          data format defined in the SCSI-3 MMC-2 standard and in
          the  Red  Book.  The  four-byte-sized  header  that  is
          defined in the SCSI standard is optional and allows  to
          make  the  recognition  of correct data less ambiguous.
          This is the best option to be used to copy CD-Text data
          from  existing  CDs that already carry CD-Text informa-
          tion. To get data in a format suitable for this  option
          use  ccddrreeccoorrdd  -vvvv -ttoocc to extract the information from
          disk.  If both, tteexxttffiillee==_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e and CD-Text  informa-
          tion   from   **..iinnff   or   **..ccuuee   files  are  present,
          tteexxttffiillee==_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e will overwrite the other information.

     -ttoocc Retrieve and print out the table of contents or PMA  of
          a  CD.   With this option, ccddrreeccoorrdd will work with CD-R
          drives and with CD-ROM drives.

     -wwaaiittii
          Wait for input to become available  on  standard  input
          before  trying  to  open  the  SCSI driver. This allows
          ccddrreeccoorrdd to read its input from a pipe even when  writ-
          ing  additional sessions to a multi-session disk.  When
          writing  another  session  to  a  multi-session   disk,
          mmkkiissooffss  needs  to read the old session from the device
          before writing output.  This cannot be done if ccddrreeccoorrdd
          opens the SCSI driver at the same time.

     -uusseeiinnffoo
          Use **..iinnff files to overwrite audio  options.   If  this
          option  is used, the pregap size information, the index
          information, the pre-emphasis information and  the  CD-
          Text  information  is  read from the **..iinnff file that is
          associated with the file that contains the  audio  data
          for a track.

          be used to write audio CDs from a pipe from ccddddaa22wwaavv if
          you call ccddrreeccoorrdd with the **..iinnff files as track parame-
          ter  list instead of using audio files.  The audio data
          is read from ssttddiinn in this case.  See _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_S  section
          below.   CCddrreeccoorrdd first verifies that ssttddiinn is not con-
          nected to a  terminal  and  runs  some  heuristic  con-
          sistency  checks  on  the **..iinnff files and then sets the
          track lengths from the information in the **..iinnff files.

          If you  like  to  write  from  ssttddiinn,  make  sure  that
          cdrecord  is  called  with  a  large  enough FIFO size,
          reduce the write speed to a value below the read  speed
          of the source drive and switch the burn-free option for
          the recording drive on.

     ddeevv==_t_a_r_g_e_t
          Set the SCSI target for the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder, see
          notes  above.  A typical target device specification is
          ddeevv==_1,_6,_0 .  If a filename must  be  provided  together
          with  the  numerical target specification, the filename
          is implementation specific.  The  correct  filename  in
          this  case  can be found in the system specific manuals
          of the target operating system.  On  a  _F_r_e_e_B_S_D  system
          without _C_A_M support, you need to use the control device
          (e.g.  /_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l).  A correct device  specification
          in this case may be ddeevv==/_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l:@ .

          _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n  of the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder. Com-
          munication on _S_u_n_O_S  is  done  with  the  SCSI  general
          driver ssccgg.. Other operating systems are using a library
          simulation of this driver.  Possible syntax  is:   ddeevv==
          _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n  or  ddeevv== _t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.  In the latter
          case, the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder has to be connected to
          the  default  SCSI bus of the machine.  _S_c_s_i_b_u_s, _t_a_r_g_e_t
          and _l_u_n are integer numbers. Some operating systems  or
          SCSI transport implementations may require to specify a
          filename in addition.  In this case the correct  syntax
          for  the device is:  ddeevv== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t, or

          node that has been specified on such a system refers to
          exactly one SCSI device, a shorthand in the  form  ddeevv==
          _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:@  or  ddeevv==  _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:@,_l_u_n  may  be  used
          instead of ddeevv== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,

          CCddrreeccoorrdd is completely based on SSCCSSII commands but  this
          is  no  problem  as all CD/DVD/BluRay writers ever made
          use SSCCSSII commands for  the  communication.  Even  AATTAAPPII
          drives are just SSCCSSII drives that inherently use the _A_T_A
          _p_a_c_k_e_t _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e as SSCCSSII command transport layer  build
          into  the IDE (ATA) transport.  You may need to specify
          an alternate transport layer on the  command   line  if
          your  OS  does  not implement a fully integrated kernel
          driver subsystem that allows to access any drive  using
          SSCCSSII commands via a single unique user interface.

          To access SCSI devices via alternate transport  layers,
          you need to prepend the SCSI device name by a transport
          layer indicator.  The transport layer indicator may  be
          something like UUSSCCSSII:: or AATTAAPPII::.  To get a list of sup-
          ported transport layers for  your  platform,  use  ddeevv==

          it hides OS specific knowledge about device names  from
          the  user.  A specific OS may not necessarily support a
          way to specify a real device file name  nor  a  way  to
          specify _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.

          If no ddeevv== option  and  no  CCDDRR__DDEEVVIICCEE  environment  is
          present,  or  if it only contains a transport specifier
          but no address notation, ccddrreeccoorrdd  tries  to  scan  the
          SCSI  address  space for CD-ROM drives.  If exactly one
          is found, this is used by default.

          find problems while opening a driver for libscg as well
          as with sector sizes and sector  types.   Using  -ddeebbuugg

          minimum timeout used for sending SCSI commands.   If  a
          SCSI  command  fails  due  to a timeout, you may try to
          raise  the  default  SCSI  command  timeout  above  the
          timeout  value  of  the failed command.  If the command
          runs correctly with a raised  command  timeout,  please

          If no ttss== option has been specified, ccddrreeccoorrdd  defaults
          to  a  transfer  size  of  63 kB.  If libscg gets lower
          values from the operating system, the value is  reduced
          to  the maximum value that is possible with the current
          operating system.  Sometimes, it may  help  to  further
          reduce  the  transfer  size  or to enhance it, but note
          that it may take a long time to find a better value  by
          experimenting with the ttss== option.

     -VV   Increment the verbose level in respect of SCSI  command

          you should use this flag to get more  detailed  output.
          -VVVV  will  show data buffer content in addition.  Using

     Track options may be mixed with track file names.

     -aauuddiioo
          If this flag is  present,  all  subsequent  tracks  are
          written  in  CCDD--DDAA  (similar to Red Book) audio format.
          The file with  data  for  this  tracks  should  contain
          stereo, 16-bit digital audio with 44100 samples/s.  The
          byte order should be the following: MSB left, LSB left,
          MSB  right,  LSB  right,  MSB left and so on. The track
          should be a multiple of 2352 bytes. It is not  possible
          to put the master image of an audio track on a raw disk
          because data will be read in  multiple  of  2352  bytes
          during the recording process.

          If a filename ends in ._a_u or  ._w_a_v  the  file  is  con-
          sidered  to  be a structured audio data file.  CCddrreeccoorrdd
          assumes that the file in this case is a Sun audio  file
          or  a  Microsoft  .WAV file and extracts the audio data
          from the files by skipping over  the  non-audio  header
          information.   In  all  other cases, cdrecord will only
          work correctly if the audio data stream does  not  have
          any header.  Because many structured audio files do not
          have an integral number of blocks (1/75th second  each)
          in  length,  it  is often necessary to specify the -ppaadd
          option as well.  ccddrreeccoorrdd recognizes that audio data in
          a  .WAV  file  is  stored in Intel (little-endian) byte
          order, and will automatically byte-swap the data if the
          CD-recorder  requires  big-endian  data.  CCddrreeccoorrdd will
          reject any audio file that does not match the Red  Book
          requirements  of 16-bit stereo samples in PCM coding at

          44100 samples/second.

          Using other structured audio data formats as  input  to
          ccddrreeccoorrdd will usually work if the structure of the data
          is the structure described above (raw pcm data in  big-
          endian  byte  order).   However,  if  the  data  format
          includes a header, you will hear a click at  the  start
          of the track.

          If  neither  -_d_a_t_a  nor  -_a_u_d_i_o  have  been  specified,
          ccddrreeccoorrdd  defaults to -_a_u_d_i_o for all filenames that end
          in ._a_u or ._w_a_v and to -_d_a_t_a for all other files.

     -ccddii If this flag is present, the TOC type for the  disk  is
          set to CCDDII.  This only makes sense with XA disks.

     -ccooppyy
          If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent
          audio tracks of the resulting CD will indicate that the
          audio data has permission to be copied  without  limit.
          This option has no effect on data tracks.

     -ddaattaa
          If this flag is  present,  all  subsequent  tracks  are
          written in CCDD--RROOMM mmooddee 11 (Yellow Book) format. The data
          size is a multiple of 2048 bytes.  The file with  track
          data  should contain an IISSOO--99666600 or RRoocckk RRiiddggee filesys-
          tem image (see mmkkiissooffss for more details). If the  track
          data  is  an uuffss filesystem image, fragment size should
          be set to 2 KB or more to  allow  CD-drives  with  2 KB
          sector size to be used for reading.

          -_d_a_t_a is the default, if no other flag is  present  and
          the file does not appear to be of one of the well known
          audio file types.

          If  neither  -_d_a_t_a  nor  -_a_u_d_i_o  have  been  specified,
          ccddrreeccoorrdd  defaults to -_a_u_d_i_o for all filenames that end
          in ._a_u or ._w_a_v and to -_d_a_t_a for all other files.

     iinnddeexx==_l_i_s_t
          Sets an index list for the next track.  In  index  list
          is  a comma separated list of numbers that are counting
          from index 1. The first entry in this list must contain
          a 0, the following numbers must be an ascending list of
          numbers (counting in 1/75 seconds) that  represent  the
          start  of  the  indices.  An  index  list  in the form:
          0,7500,15000 sets index 1 to the start  of  the  track,
          index  2  100  seconds  from the start of the track and
          index 3 200 seconds from the start of the track.

          Use the IISSOO--99666600 file system size as the  size  of  the
          next track.  This option is needed if you want ccddrreeccoorrdd
          to directly read the image of a track from a  raw  disk
          partition  or  from  a _T_A_O master CD. In the first case
          the option -iissoossiizzee is needed to limit the size of  the
          CD  to  the  size of the ISO filesystem.  In the second
          case the option -iissoossiizzee is needed to prevent  ccddrreeccoorrdd
          from  reading  the two run-out blocks that are appended
          by each CD-recorder in track-at-once  mode.  These  two
          run-out  blocks cannot be read and would cause a buffer
          underrun that would cause a defective copy.

          Note that if this option is used on  files  created  by
          mmkkiissooffss,  the padding data that was added by mmkkiissooffss is
          lost and replaced by padding added  by  cdrecord.  This
          may also change the amount of padding.

          In case ccddrreeccoorrdd reads the track data from _s_t_d_i_n,  only
          the first track may be used with the -iissoossiizzee option.

          If -iissoossiizzee is used for a track, ccddrreeccoorrdd will automat-
          ically add padding for this track as if the -ppaadd option
          had been used but the amount of  padding  may  be  less
          than  the padding written by mmkkiissooffss.  Note that if you
          use -iissoossiizzee on a track that contains Sparc boot infor-
          mation, the boot information will be lost.

          Note also that this option cannot be used to  determine
          the  size  of  a  file  system  if the -mmuullttii option is
          present.

     iissrrcc==_I_S_R_C__n_u_m_b_e_r

          Re-enforce the Red Book track length  standard.  Tracks
          must be at least 4 seconds.

     -ppaadd If the track is a data track, 15 sectors of zeroed data
          will  be  added  to the end of this and each subsequent
          data track.  In this case, the -ppaadd  option  is  super-
          seded by the ppaaddssiizzee== option. It will remain however as
          a shorthand for ppaaddssiizzee==_1_5_s.  If the -_p_a_d option refers
          to  an audio track, ccddrreeccoorrdd will pad the audio data to
          be a multiple of 2352 bytes. The audio data padding  is
          done  with  binary  zeroes  which  is equal to absolute
          silence.

          -ppaadd remains valid until disabled by -nnooppaadd.

     ppaaddssiizzee==#
          Set the amount of data to be appended as padding to the
          next  track  to #.  Opposed to the behavior of the -ppaadd
          option, the value for _p_a_d_s_i_z_e= is  reset  to  zero  for
          each new track.  Cdrecord assumes a sector size of 2048
          bytes for the _p_a_d_s_i_z_e=  option,  independent  from  the
          real  sector  size and independent from the write mode.
          The megabytes mentioned in the verbose mode output how-
          ever  are counting the output sector size which is e.g.
          2448 bytes when writing in RAW/RAW96 mode.  See the ffss=
          option  for  possible arguments.  To pad the equivalent
          of 20 minutes on a CD, you may write ppaaddssiizzee==20x60x75s.
          Use  this  option  if your CD-drive is not able to read
          the last sectors of a track or if you want to  be  able
          to  read  the  CD  on  a LLiinnuuxx system with the ISO-9660
          filesystem read-ahead bug.  If an empty  file  is  used
          for  track  data,  this  option may be used to create a
          disk that is entirely made of padding.  This  may  e.g.
          be  used  to  find out how much overburning is possible
          with a specific medium.

          If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent
          audio tracks will indicate that the audio data has been
          sampled with 50/15  microsec  pre-emphasis.   The  data
          however is not modified during the process of transfer-
          ring from file to disk. This option has  no  effect  on
          data tracks.

     pprreeggaapp==#
          Set the  pre-gap size for the next track.  This  option
          currently  only  makes  sense  with the TEAC drive when
          creating  track-at-once  disks  without  the   2-second
          silence before each track.

     -ssccmmss
          If this flag is present, all TOC entries for subsequent
          audio tracks of the resulting CD will indicate that the
          audio data has no permission to be copied anymore.

     -sshhoorrttttrraacckk
          Allow all subsequent tracks to  violate  the  Red  Book
          track  length  standard  which requires a minimum track
          length of 4 seconds.  This option is only  useful  when
          used  in  SAO or RAW mode.  Not all drives support this
          feature. The drive must accept the resulting CUE  sheet
          or support RAW writing.

     -sswwaabb
          If this flag is present, audio data is assumed to be in
          byte-swapped  (little-endian) order.  Some types of CD-
          writers e.g. Yamaha, Sony and the new SCSI-3/mmc drives
          require  audio  data  to  be presented in little-endian
          order, while other writers require  audio  data  to  be
          presented  in  the big-endian (network) byte order nor-
          mally used by the SCSI protocol.  CCddrreeccoorrdd knows  if  a
          CD-recorder  needs  audio data in big- or little-endian
          order, and corrects the byte order of the  data  stream
          to  match the needs of the recorder.  You only need the
          -_s_w_a_b flag if your data stream  is  in  Intel  (little-
          endian) byte order.

          Note that the verbose output of ccddrreeccoorrdd will show  you
          if  swapping is necessary to make the byte order of the
          input data fit the required byte order of the recorder.
          CCddrreeccoorrdd  will not show you if the -_s_w_a_b flag was actu-
          ally present for a track.

     ttssiizzee==#
          If the master image for the next track has been  stored
          on  a  raw  disk,  use this option to specify the valid
          amount of data on this disk. If the image of  the  next
          track  is  stored  in  a regular file, the size of that
          file is taken to determine the length  of  this  track.
          If  the track contains an ISO-9660 filesystem image use
          the -_i_s_o_s_i_z_e option to determine  the  length  of  that
          filesystem image.
          In Disk At Once mode and with some drives that use  the
          TEAC programming interface, even in Track At Once mode,
          ccddrreeccoorrdd needs to know the size of  each  track  before
          starting  to  write the disk.  Cdrecord now checks this
          and aborts before starting to write.  If  this  happens
          you will need to run mmkkiissooffss -pprriinntt-ssiizzee before and use
          the output (with `s' appended) as an  argument  to  the
          ttssiizzee= option of ccddrreeccoorrdd (e.g. tsize=250000s).

     Go on with:

     If the overall speed of the system  is  sufficient  and  the
     structure  of  the  filesystem  is not too complex, cdrecord
     will run without creating an image of the ISO-9660  filesys-
     tem. Simply run the pipeline:

         mkisofs -R /master/tree | cdrecord -v -dao fs=6m speed=2
     dev=2,0 -

     The recommended minimum FIFO size for running this  pipeline
     is  4  MBytes.   As  the  default FIFO size is 4 MB, the ffss==
     option needs to be present only if you want to  use  a  dif-
     ferent  FIFO size.  If your system is loaded, you should run
     mkisofs in the real-time class too.  To raise  the  priority
     of mmkkiissooffss replace the command

         mkisofs -R /master/tree
     by
         priocntl -e -c RT -p 59 mkisofs -R /master/tree

     on Solaris and by

     on systems that do  not  have  UUNNIIXX  IInntteerrnnaattiioonnaall-compliant
     real-time scheduling.

     Cdrecord runs at priority 59  on  Solaris,  you  should  run
     mkisofs  at  no more than priority 58. On other systems, you
     should run mkisofs at no less than nice --18.

     Creating a CD-ROM without file system image on disk has been
     tested  on  a  Sparcstation-2  with a Yamaha CDR-400. It did

               Each line that follows  a  label  contains  a  TAB
               separated  list  of  items.  Currently, four items
               are recognized: the SCSI  ID  of  the  drive,  the
               default  speed that should be used for this drive,
               the default FIFO size that should be used for this
               drive  and  drive specific options. The values for
               _s_p_e_e_d and _f_i_f_o_s_i_z_e  may  be  set  to  -1  to  tell
               cdrecord  to  use  the global defaults.  The value
               for driveropts may be set to "" if  no  driveropts
               are used.  A typical line may look this way:

               teac1= 0,5,0   4    8m   ""

               yamaha= 1,6,0  -1   -1   burnfree

               This tells ccddrreeccoorrdd that a drive named _t_e_a_c_1 is at
               scsibus 0, target 5, lun 0 and should be used with
               speed 4 and a FIFO size of 8 MB.  A  second  drive
               may  be  found  at  scsibus 1, target 6, lun 0 and
               uses the default speed and the default FIFO size.


     **..iinnff
          The **..iinnff files are created  by  ccddddaa22wwaavv  where  **  is
          replaced  by  the  actual  audio file prefix.  They are
          read and used by ccddrreeccoorrdd in case cdrecord  was  called
          with the -uusseeiinnffoo option.

          There are three general types of parameters:

          nnuummeerriiccaall ppaarraammeetteerrss
               A numerical parameter is  a  number  and  directly
               follows the tag label without any quoting.

          uunnqquuootteedd ssttrriinngg ttyyppee ppaarraammeetteerrss
               An unquoted parameter is make  from  one  or  more
               words  that  directly  follow  the tag label.  How
               many words from the parameter  list  are  used  by
               cdrecord depends on the tag label.

          qquuootteedd ssttrriinngg ttyyppee ppaarraammeetteerrss
               A string type  parameter  is  enclosed  in  single
               quotes.  The  string starts after the first single
               quote character that follows  the  tag  label  and
               ends  before  the  last  single  quote on the same
               line.  It needs no escape sequences in case that a
               single  quote appears inside the string.  Any text
               to the right of the rightmost single quote charac-
               ter is ignored.

          The order of the tag labels in the file is  not  impor-
          tant.

               followed  by  five digits for the recording serial
               number.

               To increase the readability of the ISRC tag, there
               may  be  a  minus sign between every two fields of
               the ISRC string.

                    related track is copyright protected and thus
                    may not be coped infinitely.  One single copy

          EEnnddiiaanneessss==
               The parameter for this tag is the byte order  used
               in  the  audio data file that was created for this
               track.

               This tag label uses an unquoted string type param-

               to have an entry for index #1, the first entry  in
               the list is always 0.  If more entries are present
               for this tag, there are more  offset  values  that
               correspond to index values greater than 1.

               This tag label uses an unquoted string type param-
               eter that contains a list of space separated index
               offset numbers.

          IInnddeexx00==
               The parameter  for  this  tag  is  a  number  that
               represents the number of sectors relatively to the
               beginning (index #1) of this track.   This  number
               identifies  where  index  #0  of  the  next  track
               begins. It the parameter is set to  -1,  the  next
               track  has no index #0, resulting in pregap size 0
               for the next track.

               Note  that  ccddrreeccoorrdd  strictly  follows  the   CD-
               standard  that  defines that the logical beginning
               of a track is  at  the  location  where  index  #1
               starts  in  this  track.   If index #0 for track nn
               contains audio data, the related audio data  is  a
               logical part of track nn--11.

          MMDD55--ooffffsseett==
               The parameter for this  tag  is  the  byte  offset
               where  the  raw  audio  data begins in the related
               audio file.

               consumed from the current data file.

               The parameter  specifies  the  postgap  length  in
               minutes, seconds and frames.

               The PPOOSSTTGGAAPP command must appear  after  all  IINNDDEEXX
               commands  for the current track.  Only one PPOOSSTTGGAAPP

               This command is used to specify the  length  of  a
               pregap  at  the  beginning  of a track. The pregap
               data is generated internally by ccddrreeccoorrdd.  No data
               is consumed from the current data file.

               The parameter  specifies  the  postgap  length  in
               minutes, seconds and frames.

               The PPRREEGGAAPP command must appear after a TTRRAACCKK  com-
               mand  but before any IINNDDEEXX command.  Only one PPRREE--

               enhancements.

               The parameter is the name of a songwriter. If  the
               string contains any spaces, it must be enclosed in
               quotation marks.

               If the SSOONNGGWWRRIITTEERR command appears before any TTRRAACCKK

               This command is used to specify a title for a disk
               that includes CD-Text enhancements.

               The parameter is the title for a track or for  the
               disk.  If  the string contains any spaces, it must
               be enclosed in quotation marks.

               If the TTIITTLLEE command appears before any TTRRAACCKK com-
               mand,  the string parameter will be encoded as the
               title of the entire disk.  If  the  TTIITTLLEE  command
               appears  after a TTRRAACCKK command, the string parame-
               ter will be encoded the the title of  the  current
               track.

               This command is used to start a new TTRRAACCKK.

               The first parameter is a track number in the range
               1-99.

               The second  parameter  specifies  the  track  data

     Not all options described in this manual may be supported by
     the  OpenSource variant of cdrecord. Cdrecord issues a warn-
     ing if an attempt is made to use an  option  that  has  been
     disabled in the OpenSource variant.

     On Solaris before Solaris 10 Update 1, you need to stop  the
     volume management if you like to use the USCSI fallback SCSI
     transport code. Even things like ccddrreeccoorrdd --ssccaannbbuuss will  not
     work if the volume management is running.

     Disks made in TTrraacckk AAtt OOnnccee mode are not suitable as a  mas-
     ter  for  direct  mass  production by CD-manufacturers.  You
     will need the ddiisskk aatt oonnccee  option  to  record  such  disks.
     Nevertheless  the  disks made in TTrraacckk AAtt OOnnccee will normally
     be read in all CD-players. Some old audio CD-players however
     may produce a two second click between two audio tracks.

     The minimal size of a track is 4 seconds or 300 sectors.  If
     you  write  smaller  tracks,  the CD-recorder will add dummy
     blocks. This is not an error,  even  though  the  SCSI-error
     message looks this way.

     The  newer  Philips/HP/Plasmon/Grundig  drives  as  well  as
     Yamaha CDR-100 and CDR-102 work also.  The  Plasmon  RF-4100
     works,  but has not been tested in multi-session.  A Philips
     CDD-521 that has not been upgraded will not work.  The  Sony
     CDU-924  has  been  tested, but does not support XA-mode2 in
     hardware.   The  Sony  therefore  cannot  create  conforming
     multi-session  disks.   The  Ricoh  RO-1420C works, but some
     people seem to have problems to use them with  speed=2,  try
     speed=0 in this case.

     The Yamaha CDR-400 and all new SCSI-3/mmc conforming  drives
     are supported in single and multi-session.

     You should run several tests in all supported speeds of your
     drive  with  the  -dduummmmyy  option  turned on if you are using
     ccddrreeccoorrdd on an unknown system. Writing a CD is  a  real-time
     process.  NNFFSS  will not always deliver constantly the needed
     data rates.  If you want to use ccddrreeccoorrdd with CD-images that
     are  located  on  a NNFFSS mounted filesystem, be sure that the
     FIFO size is big enough.   The  author  used  ccddrreeccoorrdd  with
     medium  load  on  a  SS20/502  and  even  at quad speed on a
     Sparcstation-2 which was heavily loaded, but  it  is  recom-
     mended  to  leave  the  system as lightly loaded as possible
     while writing a CD.  If you want to make  sure  that  buffer
     underruns  are  not  caused by your source disk, you may use
     the command

         ccddrreeccoorrdd -dduummmmyy ddeevv==22,,00 ppaaddssiizzee==660000mm //ddeevv//nnuullll

     to create a disk  that  is  entirely  made  of  dummy  data.
     CCddrreeccoorrdd needs to run as root to get access to the //ddeevv//ssccgg??
     device nodes and to be able to lock itself into memory.

     If you don't want to allow users to become root on your sys-
     tem, ccddrreeccoorrdd may safely be installed suid root. This allows
     all users or a group of users with no root privileges to use
     ccddrreeccoorrdd..  CCddrreeccoorrdd  in  this  case  checks if the real user
     would have been able to read the specified files.   To  give
     all users access to use ccddrreeccoorrdd,, enter:

          chown root /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord
          chmod 4711 /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord

     To give a restricted  group  of  users  access  to  cdrecord
     enter:

          chown root /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord
          chgrp cdburners /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord
          chmod 4710 /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord

     and add a group _c_d_b_u_r_n_e_r_s on your system.

     Never give write permissions  for  non  root  users  to  the
     /_d_e_v/_s_c_g?   devices   unless  you  would  allow  anybody  to
     read/write/format all your disks.

     You should not  connect  old  drives  that  do  not  support
     disconnect/reconnect  to  either  the  SCSI bus that is con-
     nected to the CD-recorder or the source disk.

     A Compact Disc can have no more than 99 tracks.

     When creating a disc with both audio and  data  tracks,  the
     data  should  be  on  track  1 otherwise you should create a
     CDplus disk which is a multi-session  disk  with  the  first
     session  containing  the audio tracks and the following ses-
     sion containing the data track.

     Many operating systems are not able to read more than a sin-
     gle data track, or need special software to do so.

     More information on the SCSI command set of a HP CD-recorder
     can be found at:

          http://www.hp.com/isgsupport/cdr/index.html

     If you have more information or  SCSI  command  manuals  for
     currently unsupported CD/DVD/BluRay-recorders please contact
     the author.

     The Philips CDD 521 CD-recorder (even in the  upgraded  ver-
     sion) has several firmware bugs. Some of them will force you
     to power cycle the device or to reboot the machine.

     When using ccddrreeccoorrdd with the LLiinnuuxx SSCCSSII ggeenneerriicc ddrriivveerr,  you
     should  note  that ccddrreeccoorrdd uses a layer, that tries to emu-
     late the functionality of the  scg  driver  on  top  of  the
     drives of the local operating system.  Unfortunately, the sg
     driver on LLiinnuuxx has several flaws:

     +o    It cannot see if a SCSI command could not  be  sent  at
          all.

     +o    It cannot get the SCSI status byte. CCddrreeccoorrdd  for  that
          reason  cannot  report  failing  SCSI  commands in some
          situations.

     +o    It cannot get real DMA count of transfer. CCddrreeccoorrdd can-
          not tell you if there is a DMA residual count.

     +o    It cannot get number of bytes valid in auto sense data.
          CCddrreeccoorrdd  cannot  tell you if device transfers no sense
          data at all.

     +o    It  fetches  too  few  data  in  auto   request   sense
          (CCS/SCSI-2/SCSI-3 needs >= 18).

     The FIFO percent output is computed just after  a  block  of
     data  has  been  written  to the CD/DVD/BluRay-recorder. For
     this reason, there will never be 100% FIFO fill ratio  while
     the FIFO is in streaming mode.

     see the message:

     Starting to write CD at speed %d in %s mode for %s session.

     A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:

          cdrecord: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no error
          CDB:  00 20 00 00 00 00

     The first line gives information about the transport of  the
     command.   The  text  after  the first colon gives the error
     text for the system call from the view  of  the  kernel.  It
     usually  is:   II//OO  eerrrroorr  unless other problems happen. The
     next words contain a short description for the SCSI  command
     that fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were any
     problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
     ffaattaall  eerrrroorr means that it was not possible to transport the
     command (i.e.  no  device  present  at  the  requested  SCSI
     address).

     The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block for
     the failed command.

     The third line gives information on  the  SCSI  status  code
     returned  by  the  command,  if the transport of the command
     succeeds. This is error information from the SCSI device.

     The fourth line is a hex dump  of  the  auto  request  sense
     information for the command.

     The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if avail-
     able,  followed by the segment number which is only valid if
     the command was a _c_o_p_y command. If the error message is  not
     directly  related  to the current command, the text _d_e_f_e_r_r_e_d
     _e_r_r_o_r is appended.

     The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and  the
     sense  qualifier if available.  If the type of the device is
     known, the sense data is decoded from tables in _s_c_s_i_e_r_r_s._c .
     The text is followed by the error value for a field replace-
     able unit.

     The seventh line prints the block number that is related  to
     the  failed  command  and  text for several error flags. The

     block number may not be valid.

     The eighth line reports the timeout set up for this  command
     and the time that the command really needed to complete.

     The following message is not an error:

     The interfaces provided by ccddrreeccoorrdd are  designed  for  long
     term  stability.  As ccddrreeccoorrdd depends on interfaces provided
     by the underlying operating system,  the  stability  of  the
     interfaces offered by ccddrreeccoorrdd depends on the interface sta-
     bility of the OS interfaces. Modified interfaces in  the  OS
     may enforce modified interfaces in ccddrreeccoorrdd.
