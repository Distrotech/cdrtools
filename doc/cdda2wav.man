     cdda2wav - dumps CD audio data into sound files  with  extra
     data verification

     ccddddaa22wwaavv can retrieve audio tracks from  CDROM  drives  that
     are  capable of reading audio data digitally to the host via
     SCSI (CCDDDDAA).

     As ccddddaa22wwaavv implements strategies  to  work  around  typical
     defects on audio CDs it reads many disks that cannot be read
     by other software.  As ccddddaa22wwaavv may  be  told  to  use  lliibb--
     ppaarraannooiiaa  (see  -ppaarraannooiiaa  option  below) to verify the data
     that has been read from the  medium,  it  delivers  superior
     quality  even  if the medium is dusty, scratched or if other
     problems occur.

     As ccddddaa22wwaavv may be directed  to  write  the  audio  data  to
     stdout, it writes all it's informational output to stderr by
     default. See oouutt-ffdd==_d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_o_r option below.

  DDeeffaauulltt sseettttiinnggss
     CCddddaa22wwaavv defaults to reead the first audio  track  from  the
     medium   and   the   default   verbose   level   is  set  to
     -vvttoocc,,ssuummmmaarryy,,sseeccttoorrss,,ttiittlleess and ccddddaa22wwaavv by default  writes
     **..iinnff  files.   To  extract  all  audio  tracks with quality
     verification, it is recommended to call:

     ccddddaa22wwaavv --vvaallll ccddddbb==00 --ppaarraannooiiaa --BB

  DDeevviiccee nnaammiinngg
     Most users do not need to care about device naming  at  all.
     If  no  ddeevv==  option was specified, ccddddaa22wwaavv implements aauuttoo
     ttaarrggeett support and automagically finds  the  drive  in  case
     that  exactly one CD-ROM type drive is available in the sys-
     tem.  In case that more than one CD-ROM type drive exists on
     the system, a list of possible device name parameters may be
     retrieved with ccddddaa22wwaavv -ssccaannbbuuss or from the target  example
     from  the output of ccddddaa22wwaavv ddeevv==hheellpp, then the ddeevv== parame-
     ter may be set based on the device listing.

     The _d_e_v_i_c_e parameter to  the  ddeevv==  option  explained  below
     refers  to _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n of the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder.
     If a file /etc/default/cdrecord exists, the parameter to the
     ddeevv== option may also be a drive name label in said file (see
     FILES section).

          sets endianess of the input samples to 'little', 'big',
          'machine'  or  'guess' to override defaults.  The value
          'machine' or 'host' is evaluated  as  the  actual  byte
          order of the host CPU in the current OS.

          The default is to detect cdrom endianess automatically.

     -ccuueeffiillee
          Create a CDRWIN compatible CUE file.  A CUE  file  that
          completely follows the CDRWIN documentation can only be
          used to create 1:1 copies if there  is  a  single  file
          with  audio  data  for  the whole disk.  The *.inf file
          format implements  more  audio  CD  features  than  the
          CDRWIN CUE format and it allows to create 1:1 copies if
          there is one audio data file per track.   Use  the  CUE
          file  format for meta data only if you really need this
          format.

          To allow ccddddaa22wwaavv to create CUE files,  you  must  also
          specify  -tt  aallll  to  switch  ccddddaa22wwaavv into a mode that
          creates a single audio data file for the whole CD.

     -ddeeeemmpphhaassiizzee
          undo the effect of pre-emphasis in the input samples.

          The default is to keep the audio data in the same state
          as  on the medium and to mark the pre-emphasis state in
          the **..iinnff files.

          sets endianess of the output samples to 'little', 'big'
          or  'machine' to override the default which is 'network
          byte order'  (big  endian).   The  value  'machine'  or
          'host'  is  evaluated  as  the actual byte order of the

          Ignore hidden tracks on the CD.  By  default,  ccddddaa22wwaavv
          checks  whether  there  might  be a hidden track before
          track 1.  This check may take a few  seconds  and  thus
          can be disabled with -nnoo-hhiiddddeenn-ttrraacckk.

          does not write to a  file,  it  just  reads  (e.g.  for
          debugging  purposes).   If this option is used together
          with the -ee option, the CD is read and the  audio  con-
          tent  is played back to the sound device without creat-
          ing output files with audio data.

     -nnoo-tteexxttddeeffaauullttss
          By default, ccddddaa22wwaavv replaces empty CD-Text fields from
          tracks  by the related CD-Text fiel for the whole CD in
          case this is defined. If the option -nnoo-tteexxttddeeffaauullttss is
          used,  ccddddaa22wwaavv leaves the track related CD-Text fields
          empty in such a case.

     -nnoo-tteexxttffiillee
          If ccddddaa22wwaavv encounters useful  CD-Text  information  on
          the   CD,   it  writes  a  .cdtext  file.   The  option

          If no -II or -iinntteerrffaaccee option has been  specified,  the

          For   this   reason,   avoid   using   parameters  like

          The setting of the environment variable CCDDDDAA__DDEEVVIICCEE  is
          overridden by this option.

          If no ddeevv== option is present, or  if  the  ddeevv==  option
          only  contains  a  transport  specifyer but no address,
          ccddddaa22wwaavv tries to scan the SCSI address space  for  CD-
          ROM  drives.   If exactly one is found, this is used by
          default.

          For more information, see the description of  the  ddeevv==

          Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and print  the

          If no ttss== option has been specified, ccddddaa22wwaavv  defaults
          to a transfer size of 3 MB. If libscg gets lower values
          from the operating system, the value is reduced to  the
          maximum value that is possible with the current operat-
          ing system.  Sometimes, it may help to  further  reduce
          the  transfer  size  or to enhance it, but note that it
          may take a long time to find a better value by  experi-
          menting with the ttss== option.

          Some operating systems return wrong values for the max-
          imum  transfer  size.  If the transfer totally hangs or

     ccddddaa22wwaavv is able to read parts of an aauuddiioo CD or  mmuullttiimmeeddiiaa
     CDROM  (containing  audio  parts)  directly digitally. These
     parts can be written to a file, a pipe, or to a  sound  dev-
     ice.

     ccddddaa22wwaavv stands for CCDDDDAA to WWAAVV (where CCDDDDAA stands for  com-
     pact  disc  digital  audio  and WWAAVV is a sound sample format
     introduced by MS Windows).  It  allows  copying  CCDDDDAA  audio
     data  from  the CDROM drive into a file in WWAAVV or other for-
     mats.

     Some versions of ccddddaa22wwaavv may try to  get  higher  real-time
     scheduling   priorities  to  ensure  smooth  (uninterrupted)
     operation. These priorities are available  for  super  users
     and are higher than those of 'normal' processes. Thus delays
     are minimized.

     If you only have one CDROM and it is loaded  with  an  audio
     CD,  you  may  simply invoke ccddddaa22wwaavv and it will create the

     -AA _a_u_x_d_e_v_i_c_e may be needed in some rare cases  for  CD-Extra
     handling.   CCddddaa22wwaavv  usually  has  no  problem  to  get the
     multi-session information for CD-Extra using raw  SCSI  com-
     mands.  For Non-SCSI-CDROM drives this is the same device as
     given by ddeevv== (see above). For SCSI-CDROM drives it  is  the
     CDROM  drive (SCSI) device (i.e. //ddeevv//ssrr00 ) corresponding to
     the SCSI device (i.e.  00,,33,,00 ). It has to match  the  device
     used for sampling.

     -II _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e selects the CDROM drive  communication  method.
     This  interface  method  is typically automatically selected
     from the device name.  For SCSI drives ggeenneerriicc__ssccssii is  used
     (cooked_ioctl  may not be available for all devices).  Valid
     names are ggeenneerriicc__ssccssii and ccooookkeedd__iiooccttll.  The first uses the
     generic  SCSI  interface,  the  latter uses the ioctl of the
     CDROM driver. The latter variant works only when the  kernel
     driver  supports  CCDDDDAA  reading. This entry has to match the
     selected CDROM device (see above).

     -tt _n+_m selects nn as the start track and optionally mm as  the
     last  track of a range to be recorded.  These tracks must be
     from the table of  contents.   This  sets  the  track  where
     recording  begins. Recording can advance through the follow-
     ing tracks as well (limited by the  optional  end  track  or
     otherwise  depending on recording time). Whether one file or
     different files are then created depends on  the  -BB  option
     (see below).

     -ii _n selects the index to  start  recording  with.   Indices

     -dd  nn sets recording time to _n seconds or set recording time
     for  whole track if _n is zero. In order to specify the dura-
     tion in frames (sectors) also,  the  argument  can  have  an
     appended  'f'. Then the numerical argument is to be taken as
     frames (sectors) rather than seconds.  Please note  that  if
     track  ranges  are being used they define the recording time
     as well thus overriding any -dd option specified times.

     Recording time is defined as the time the  generated  sample
     will  play  (at the defined sample rate). Since it's related
     to the amount of generated samples, it's not the time of the
     sampling  process  itself (which can be less or more).  It's
     neither strictly coupled with the time  information  on  the
     audio  CD  (shown  by your hifi CD player).  Differences can
     occur by the usage of the -oo option (see below). Notice that
     recording  time  will be shortened, unless enough disk space
     exists. Recording can be aborted at anytime by pressing  the
     break character (signal SIGQUIT).

     By  this option you are able to skip a certain amount at the
     beginning of a track so you can pick exactly  the  part  you
     want.  Each  sector  runs for 1/75 seconds, so you have very
     fine control. If your offset is so high that  it  would  not
     fit  into the current track, a warning message is issued and
     the offset is ignored.  Recording time is not reduced.   (To

     they cover the complete sampling  process.  They  are  taken
     from  the  original  samples  and have the same format (i.e.

     which reads the q-subchannel of each track. If  pre-emphasis
     is  indicated in the q-subchannel of a track, but not in the

     compatible  to  Wind*ws  sound files, they have lsb,msb byte
     order which is the opposite byte order to the  one  used  on
     the audio cd. The default filename extension is '.wav'.  Sun
     type files are not like  the  older  common  logarithmically
     coded  .au  files, but instead as mentioned above linear PCM
     is used. The byte order is msb,lsb  to  be  compatible.  The
     default filename extension is '.au'.  The AIFF and the newer
     variant AIFC from the Apple/SGI world store their samples in
     bigendian  format (msb,lsb). In AIFC no compression is used.
     Finally the easiest 'format', the cdr aka raw format. It  is
     done  per default in msb,lsb byte order to satisfy the order
     wanted by most cd writers. Since there is no header informa-
     tion in this format, the sample parameters can only be iden-
     tified by playing the samples on a soundcard or similar. The
     default filename extension is '.cdr' or '.raw'.

HHIINNTTSS OONN UUSSAAGGEE
     Don't create samples you cannot read. First check your  sam-
     ple  player  software and sound card hardware. I experienced
     problems with very low sample rates (stereo <= 1575 Hz, mono
     <=  3675  Hz)  when  trying  to  play them with standard WAV
     players for sound blaster (maybe they are not legal  in  WWAAVV
     format). Most CD-Writers insist on audio samples in a bigen-
     dian format.  Now cdda2wav supports the -EE  eennddiiaanneessss option
     to control the endianess of the written samples.

     If your hardware is fast enough  to  run  cdda2wav  uninter-
     rupted  and  your CD drive is one of the 'perfect' ones, you
     will gain speed when switching all overlap sampling off with
     the  -PP   00 option. Further fine tuning can be done with the
     -nn  sseeccttoorrss option. You can specify how much sectors  should
     be requested in one go.

     Cdda2wav supports  ppiippeess.   Use  a  filename  of  -  to  let
     cdda2wav output its samples to standard output.

     Conversion to other sound formats can be done using the  ssooxx
     program  package  (although  the use of ssooxx -xx to change the
     byte order of samples  should  be  no  more  necessary;  see
     option -EE to change the output byteorder).

     If you want to sample more than  one  track  into  different
     files  in  one  run,  this is currently possible with the -BB
     option. When recording time exceeds the track  limit  a  new
     file will be opened for the next track.

FFIILLEESS
     Cdda2wav can generate a lot of files for various purposes.

  AAuuddiioo ffiilleess::
     There are audio files containing samples with default exten-
     sions  .wav,  .au,  .aifc,  .aiff, and .cdr according to the
     selected sound format.  These files are not  generated  when
     option (-NN) is given. Multiple files may be written when the
     bulk copy option (-BB) is used. Individual file names can  be
     given  as  arguments.  If  the number of file names given is
     sufficient to cover all  included  audio  tracks,  the  file
     names  will  be used verbatim.  Otherwise, if there are less
     file names than files needed to write the  included  tracks,
     the  part  of the file name before the extension is extended
     with '_dd' where dd represents the current track number.

  CCddddbb aanndd CCddiinnddeexx ffiilleess::
     If cdda2wav detects cd-extra or cd-text (album/track)  title
     information, then .cddb, .cdindex and .cdtext files are gen-
     erated unless suppressed by the  option  -HH.   They  contain
     suitable  formatted entries for submission to audio cd track
     title databases in the internet. The  CDINDEX  and  CDDB(tm)
     systems are currently supported. For more information please
     visit www.musicbrainz.org and www.freedb.com.

  IInnff ffiilleess::
     The inf files are describing the sample files and  the  part
     from  the  audio  cd, it was taken from. They are a means to
     transfer information to a cd burning program like  cdrecord.
     For  example,  if  the  original  audio  cd had pre-emphasis
     enabled, and cdda2wav -TT did remove the  pre-emphasis,  then
     the  inf file has pre-emphasis not set (since the audio file
     does not have it anymore), while the .cddb and the  .cdindex
     have pre-emphasis set as the original does.

WWAARRNNIINNGG
     IIMMPPOORRTTAANNTT:: it is prohibited to sell  copies  of  copyrighted

     used to circumvent copyrights.  The user  acknowledges  this
     constraint when using the software.

BBUUGGSS
     The index scanner may give timeouts.

     The resampling (rate conversion code) uses polynomial inter-
     polation, which is not optimal.
