     mmkkiissooffss is effectively a pre-mastering program  to  generate
     an ISO-9660/JOLIET/HFS/UDF hybrid filesystem.

     ISO-9660/JOLIET/UDF filesystems are  limited  to  a  maximum
     size  of  8 TB.   The  maximum size of a single file is 8 TB
     (single  files  in  UDF  are  currently  limited  to  aprox.
     200 GB).   If  yo  like  to have files larger than 2 GB, you
     need to specify -iissoo-lleevveell 33 or above.  If a HFS  hybrid  is
     created,  the  maximum file size for files in the HFS hybrid
     is 2 GB in any case.

     mmkkiissooffss is capable of generating the SSyysstteemm UUssee SShhaarriinngg PPrroo--

     PPrroottooccooll.. This is used to further describe the files in  the
     ISO-9660 filesystem to a unix host, and provides information
     such as longer filenames, uid/gid, posix  permissions,  sym-
     bolic links, hard links, block and character devices.

     If Joliet, HFS or UDF hybrid command line options are speci-
     fied,  mmkkiissooffss  will  create  additional separate filesystem
     meta data for Joliet, HFS or UDF.  The file content in  this
     case  refers  to the same data blocks on the media.  It will
     generate a pure ISO-9660 filesystem unless the  Joliet,  HFS
     or UDF hybrid command line options are given.

     mmkkiissooffss can generate a _t_r_u_e (or _s_h_a_r_e_d) HFS hybrid  filesys-
     tem. The same files are seen as HFS files when accessed from
     a Macintosh and as ISO-9660 files when accessed  from  other
     machines. HFS stands for _H_i_e_r_a_r_c_h_i_c_a_l _F_i_l_e _S_y_s_t_e_m and is the
     native  file  system  used  on  Macintosh  computers  up  to
     Mac OS 9.

     As an alternative, mmkkiissooffss can generate the _A_p_p_l_e _E_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_s
     _t_o  _I_S_O-_9_6_6_0  or _U_D_F for each file. These extensions provide
     each file with CREATOR, TYPE and certain Finder  Flags  when
     accessed  from  a Macintosh. See the HHFFSS MMAACCIINNTTOOSSHH FFIILLEE FFOORR--

     mmkkiissooffss takes a snapshot of a given directory tree, and gen-
     erates  a  binary image which will correspond to an ISO-9660
     or Joliet/HFS/UDF filesystem when written to a block device.

     Each file written to the ISO-9660  filesystem  must  have  a
     filename  in the 8.3 format (8 characters, period, 3 charac-
     ters, all upper case), even if Rock Ridge attributes are  in
     use.   This filename is used on systems that are not able to
     make use of the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS),  and
     each  filename  in each directory must be different from the
     other filenames in the same  directory.   mmkkiissooffss  generally
     tries  to form correct names by forcing the unix filename to
     upper case and truncating as required, but often times  this
     yields unsatisfactory results when there are cases where the
     truncated names are not all unique.  mmkkiissooffss assigns weight-
     ings  to  each filename, and if two names that are otherwise
     the same are found the  name  with  the  lower  priority  is
     renamed  to have a 3 digit number as an extension (where the
     number is guaranteed to be  unique).   An  example  of  this
     would  be  the  files  foo.bar  and  foo.bar.~1~  - the file
     foo.bar.~1~ would be written as FOO000.BAR;1  and  the  file
     foo.bar would be written as FOO.BAR;1

     When used with various HFS  or  UDF  options,  mmkkiissooffss  will
     attempt  to recognise files stored in a number of Apple/Unix
     file formats and will copy the data and  resource  forks  as
     well  as any relevant finder information. See the HHFFSS MMAACCIINN--
     TTOOSSHH FFIILLEE FFOORRMMAATTSS  section  below  for  more  about  formats
     mmkkiissooffss supports.

     Note that mmkkiissooffss is not designed to communicate with  writ-
     ers   for   optical   media  directly.   Most  writers  have
     proprietary command sets which vary from one manufacturer to
     another,  and  you  need a specialized tool like ccddrreeccoorrdd to
     actually burn the disk.

     The ccddrreeccoorrdd utility is a  utility  capable  of  burning  an
     actual  disc.   The  latest version of ccddrreeccoorrdd is available
     from          ffttpp::////ffttpp..bbeerrlliiooss..ddee//ppuubb//ccddrreeccoorrdd           or
     ffttpp::////ffttpp..bbeerrlliiooss..ddee//ppuubb//ccddrreeccoorrdd//aallpphhaa

     Also you should know that most cd writers are very  particu-
     lar about timing.  Once you start to burn a disc, you cannot
     let their buffer empty before you are done, or you will  end
     up  with  a  corrupt  disc.  Thus it is critical that you be
     able to maintain an uninterrupted data stream to the  writer
     for the entire time that the disc is being written.

     ppaatthhssppeecc is the path of the directory tree to be copied into
     the  ISO-9660  filesystem.  Multiple paths can be specified,
     and mmkkiissooffss will merge the files found in all of the  speci-
     fied path components to form the cdrom image.

     If the option -ggrraafftt-ppooiinnttss has been specified, it is possi-
     ble  to  graft  the  paths  at  points  other  than the root

     directory, and it is possible to graft files or  directories
     onto  the  cdrom  image  with names different than what they
     have in the source filesystem.  This is  easiest  to  illus-
     trate  with  a couple of examples.   Let's start by assuming
     that a local file ../old.lis exists, and you wish to include
     it in the cdrom image.


          foo/bar/=../old.lis

     will  include  the  file  old.lis  in  the  cdrom  image  at
     /foo/bar/old.lis, while

          foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis

     will  include  the  file  old.lis  in  the  cdrom  image  at
     /foo/bar/xxx.   The  same  sort  of  syntax can be used with
     directories as well.  mmkkiissooffss will  create  any  directories
     required such that the graft points exist on the cdrom image
     - the directories do not need to appear in one of the paths.
     By default, any directories that are created on the fly like
     this will have permissions 0555 and appear to  be  owned  by
     the  person  running mkisofs.  If you wish other permissions
     or owners of the intermediate directories, see  -uuiidd,  -ggiidd,
     -ddiirr-mmooddee, -ffiillee-mmooddee and -nneeww-ddiirr-mmooddee.

     mmkkiissooffss will also run on Win9_x/NT_x  machines  when  compiled
     with        Cygnus'       cygwin       (available       from
     http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/). Therefore most refer-
     ences in this man page to _U_n_i_x also apply to _W_i_n_3_2 or _W_i_n_6_4.

          Specifies the abstract file name in the primary  volume
          descriptor.   There is space on the disc for 37 charac-
          ters of information.  The related Joliet entry is  lim-
          ited  to 18 characters.  This parameter can also be set
          in the file ..mmkkiissooffssrrcc with ABST=filename.   If  speci-

     -llddoottss
          Allow ISO-9660 filenames to begin with a period.   Usu-
          ally,  a  leading dot is replaced with an underscore in
          order to maintain MS-DOS compatibility.
          This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens  to
          work on many systems.  Use with caution.

     -aallllooww-lloowweerrccaassee
          This options allows lower case characters to appear  in
          ISO-9660 filenames.
          This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens  to
          work on some systems.  Use with caution.

     -aallllooww-mmuullttiiddoott
          This options allows more than  one  dot  to  appear  in
          ISO-9660  filenames.   A leading dot is not affected by
          this option, it may be  allowed  separately  using  the
          -aallllooww-lleeaaddiinngg-ddoottss option.
          This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens  to
          work on many systems.  Use with caution.

     -bbiibblliioo _F_I_L_E
          Specifies the bibliographic file name  in  the  primary
          volume  descriptor.   There is space on the disc for 37
          characters of information.  The related Joliet entry is
          limited  to  18 characters.  This parameter can also be
          set in the file  ..mmkkiissooffssrrcc  with  BIBLO=filename.   If
          specified  in  both places, the command line version is
          used.

          It is up to the user of mmkkiissooffss to include a file  with
          the apropriate name in the created filesystem tree.

     -ccaacchhee-iinnooddeess
          Cache inode and device numbers to find  hard  links  to
          files.   If mmkkiissooffss finds a hard link (a file with mul-
          tiple names), then the file will only  appear  once  on
          the CD. This helps to save space on the CD.  The option
          -ccaacchhee-iinnooddeess is default on UNIX  like  operating  sys-
          tems.   Be careful when using this option on a filesys-
          tem without unique inode numbers as it  may  result  in
          files containing the wrong content on CD.

          If inodes are not cached, mmkkiissooffss will  revert  to  the
          old  Rrip  Version-1.10 (see -rrrriipp111100) and mmkkiissooffss will
          not be able to create ccoorrrreecctt iinnooddee  nnuummbbeerrss  for  zero
          sized files.

     -nnoo-ccaacchhee-iinnooddeess
          Do not cache inode and device numbers.  This option  is
          needed whenever a filesystem does not have unique inode
          numbers. It is the default on old CCyyggwwiinn versions.   As
          the  Microsoft  operating system that runs below CCyyggwwiinn
          uses 64 bit inode numbers for NTFS, it  does  not  have
          unique  inode  numbers in the 32 bit range.  Old Cygwin
          versions create fake 32-bit inode numbers from  a  hash
          algorithm  and  thus  create  non-unique  numbers.   If
          mmkkiissooffss would cache inodes on old Cygwin  versions,  it
          would  believe  that  some files are identical although
          they are not. The result in this case  are  files  that
          contain  the  wrong  content if a significant amount of
          different files (> ~5000) is in inside the tree that is
          to   be  archived.   This  does  not  happen  when  the
          -nnoo-ccaacchhee-iinnooddeess is used, but the disadvantage is  that
          mmkkiissooffss cannot detect hardlinks anymore and the result-
          ing CD image may be larger than expected.

          If inodes are not cached, mmkkiissooffss will  revert  to  the
          old  Rrip  Version-1.10 (see -rrrriipp111100) and mmkkiissooffss will
          not be able to create ccoorrrreecctt iinnooddee  nnuummbbeerrss  for  zero
          sized files.

     -bb _e_l_t_o_r_i_t_o__b_o_o_t__i_m_a_g_e
          Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be
          used  when making an "El Torito" bootable CD. The path-
          name must be relative to the source path  specified  to
          mmkkiissooffss.. This option is required to make an "El Torito"
          bootable CD.  The boot image must be exactly  the  size
          of  either  a  1200,  1440,  or  a  2880 kB floppy, and
          mmkkiissooffss will use this size  when  creating  the  output
          ISO-9660  filesystem.  It is assumed that the first 512
          byte sector should be read from the boot image  (it  is
          essentially  emulating  a  normal  floppy drive).  This
          will work, for example, if the boot  image  is  a  LILO
          based boot floppy.

          If the boot image is not an image of a floppy, you need
          to   add   one  of  the  options:   -hhaarrdd-ddiisskk-bboooott  or
          -nnoo-eemmuull-bboooott.  If the system should not boot  off  the
          emulated disk, use -nnoo-bboooott.

          If the -ssoorrtt option has not been  specified,  the  boot
          images  are sorted with low priority (+2) to the begin-
          ning of the medium.  If you don't like this,  you  need
          to specify a sort weight of 0 for the boot images.

     -eellttoorriittoo-aalltt-bboooott
          Start with a new set of "El  Torito"  boot  parameters.
          This  allows  to have more than one El Torito boot on a
          CD.  A maximum of 63 El Torito boot entries may be  put

          Add the content from file _n_a_m_e  to  the  error  control
          definitions or add _e_r_r_o_r _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _s_p_e_c to the error con-
          trol definitions.  More than one error control file and
          more  than  one _e_r_r_o_r _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _s_p_e_c as well as a mixture
          of both forms is possible.

          The reason for using error control is to  make  mmkkiissooffss
          quiet  about  error  conditions  that  are  known to be
          irrelevant on the quality of the created filesystem  or
          to  tell  mmkkiissooffss  to abort on certain error conditions
          instead of trying to continue with the filesystem.

          A typical reason to use error control  is  to  suppress
          warnings  about  growing log files while doing a backup
          on a live file system.  Another typical reason  to  use
          error  control  is  to  tell mmkkiissooffss to abort if e.g. a
          file could not be archived  instead  of  continuing  to
          archive other files from a list.

          The error control file contains a set  of  lines,  each
          starting  with a list of error conditions to be ignored
          followed by white space followed by a file name pattern
          (see  mmaattcchh(1)  or  ppaattmmaattcchh(3)  for more information).
          The _e_r_r_o_r _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _s_p_e_c uses the same syntax as a single
          line  from  the  error  control file.  If the file name
          pattern  needs  to  start  with  white  space,  use   a
          backslash  to  escape the start of the file name. It is
          not possible to have new line characters  in  the  file
          name  pattern.   Whenever an error situation is encoun-
          tered, mmkkiissooffss checks the lines in  the  error  control
          file  starting from the top.  If the current error con-
          dition is listed on a line in the error  control  file,
          then  mmkkiissooffss checks whether the pattern on the rest of
          the line matches the current file name.  If this is the
          case, mmkkiissooffss uses the current error control specifica-
          tion to control the current error condition.

          The list of error conditions to be handled may use  one
          or  more  (in  this  case separated by a '|' character)
          identifiers from the list below:

          Specifies a comma separated list of  boot  images  that
          are  needed  to  make  a bootable CD for sparc systems.
          Partition 0 is used for the ISO-9660 image,  the  first
          image  file  is  mapped  to  partition 1.  There may be
          empty fields in the comma separated list.  The  maximum
          number  of possible partitions is 8 so it is impossible
          to specify more than 7 partition images.   This  option
          is  required  to  make a bootable CD for Sun sparc sys-
          tems.  If the -BB or -ssppaarrcc-bboooott option has been  speci-
          fied, the first sector of the resulting image will con-
          tain a Sun disk label. This disk label specifies  slice
          0  for  the  ISO-9660 image and slice 1 ... slice 7 for
          the boot images that  have  been  specified  with  this
          option.  Byte  offset  512  ... 8191 within each of the
          additional boot images must contain a primary boot that
          works  for the appropriate sparc architecture. The rest
          of each of the images usually contains an ufs  filesys-
          tem that is used primary kernel boot stage.

          The implemented boot method is the  boot  method  found
          with  SunOS  4.x  and  SunOS 5.x.  However, it does not
          depend on SunOS internals but only on properties of the
          Open  Boot  prom.  For this reason, it should be usable
          for any OS that boots off a sparc system.

          If the special filename ...... is used, the actual and all

     -GG _g_e_n_e_r_i_c__b_o_o_t__i_m_a_g_e
          Specifies the path and filename  of  the  generic  boot
          image  to  be  used  when making a generic bootable CD.
          The ggeenneerriicc__bboooott__iimmaaggee will be placed on the  first  16
          sectors of the CD. The first 16 sectors are the sectors
          that are located before  the  ISO-9660  primary  volume
          descriptor.   If  this option is used together with the
          -ssppaarrcc-bboooott option, the Sun disk label will overlay the
          first 512 bytes of the generic boot image.

     -hhaarrdd-ddiisskk-bboooott
          Specifies that the boot image used to create  "El  Tor-
          ito"  bootable  CDs is a hard disk image. The hard disk
          image must begin with a master boot  record  that  con-
          tains a single partition.

     -nnoo-eemmuull-bboooott
          Specifies that the boot image used to create  "El  Tor-
          ito" bootable CDs is a 'no emulation' image. The system
          will load and execute this image without performing any
          disk emulation.

     -nnoo-bboooott
          Specifies that the created "El  Torito"  CD  should  be
          marked as not bootable. The system will provide an emu-
          lated drive for the image, but will boot off a standard
          boot device.

          Specifies the number of "virtual" (512-byte) sectors to
          load  in no-emulation mode.  The default is to load the
          entire boot file.  Some BIOSes  may  have  problems  if
          this is not a multiple of 4.

     -bboooott-iinnffoo-ttaabbllee
          Specifies that a 56-byte table with information of  the
          CD-ROM  layout  will  be  patched in at offset 8 in the
          boot file.  If this option is given, the boot  file  is
          modified in the source filesystem, so make sure to make
          a copy if this file cannot be easily regenerated!   See

          CDextra  or  the  image of a second session or a higher
          level session for a multi session disk.  The option  -CC
          takes  a  pair of two numbers separated by a comma. The
          first number is the sector number of the  first  sector
          in the last session of the disk that should be appended
          to.  The second number is the starting sector number of
          the  new  session.  The expected pair of numbers may be
          retrieved by calling ccddrreeccoorrdd -mmssiinnffoo  ......  If  the  -CC
          option  is  used  in  conjunction  with  the -MM option,
          mmkkiissooffss will create a filesystem image that is intended
          to  be  a continuation of the previous session.  If the
          -CC option is used without the -MM option,  mmkkiissooffss  will
          create  a  filesystem image that is intended to be used
          for a second session on a CDextra. This is a multi ses-
          sion  CD that holds audio data in the first session and
          a ISO-9660 filesystem in the second session.

     -cc _b_o_o_t__c_a_t_a_l_o_g
          Specifies the path and filename of the boot catalog  to
          be  used  when  making  an "El Torito" bootable CD. The
          pathname must be relative to the source path  specified
          to  mmkkiissooffss.. This option is required to make a bootable
          CD.  This file will be inserted into  the  output  tree
          and  not  created  in the source filesystem, so be sure
          the specified filename does not conflict with an exist-
          ing  file,  as it will be excluded. Usually a name like
          "boot.catalog" is chosen.

          If the -ssoorrtt option has not been  specified,  the  boot
          catalog  sorted with low priority (+1) to the beginning
          of the medium.  If you don't like  this,  you  need  to
          specify a sort weight of 0 for the boot catalog.

     -cchheecckk-oollddnnaammeess
          Check all filenames imported from old session for  com-

          It his option is not present, only names with a  length
          > 31 are checked as these files are a hard violation of
          the ISO-9660 standard.

     -cchheecckk-sseessssiioonn _F_I_L_E

     -dd   Omit trailing period from files  that  do  not  have  a

     -ddaattaa-cchhaannggee-wwaarrnn
          If the size of a file changes while the file  is  being
          archived,  treat  this condition as a warning only that
          does not cause mmkkiissooffss to abort.  A warning message  is
          still written if the condition is not otherwise ignored

     -ddiirr-mmooddee _m_o_d_e
          Overrides the mode of directories used  to  create  the

          enables Rock Ridge extensions.

     -ddvvdd-vviiddeeoo
          Generate DVD-Video compliant UDF file system.  This  is
          done  by  sorting  the  order  of  the  content  of the
          appropriate files and by  adding  padding  between  the
          files  if  needed.  Note that the sorting only works if
          the DVD-Video filenames include upper  case  characters
          only.
          Note  that  in  order  to  get  a  DVD-Video  compliant
          filesystem  image, you need to prepare a DVD-Video com-
          pliant directory tree. This means you need  to  have  a
          directory  VIDEO_TS (all caps) in the root directory of
          the resulting DVD  and  you  should  have  a  directory
          AUDIO_TS.  The  directory VIDEO_TS needs to include all
          needed files (file names must be all caps) for  a  com-
          pliant DVD-Video filesystem.

     -ffiillee-mmooddee _m_o_d_e
          Overrides the mode of regular files used to create  the
          image  to  _m_o_d_e.   Specifying this option automatically
          enables Rock Ridge extensions.

     -ffiinndd
          This option acts a  separator.   If  it  is  used,  all
          mmkkiissooffss  options  must  be  to  the  left  of the -ffiinndd
          option. To the  right  of  the  -ffiinndd  option,  mmkkiissooffss
          accepts the ffiinndd command line syntax only.

          The ffiinndd expression acts as a filter between the source
          of  file  names  and  the  consumer, which is archiving
          engine.  If the ffiinndd expression evaluated as TRUE, then
          the  related file is selected for processing, otherwise
          it is omited.

          In order to make the evaluation of the ffiinndd  expression
          more  convenient,  mmkkiissooffss  implements  additional ffiinndd
          pprriimmaarriieess that have side effects on the file meta data.
          MMkkiissooffss  implements  the following additional ffiinndd pri-
          maries:

          -hheellpp
               Lists the available ffiinndd(1) syntax.

          -cchhggrrpp _g_n_a_m_e
               The primary always evaluates as true; it sets  the
               group of the file to _g_n_a_m_e.

          -cchhmmoodd _m_o_d_e
               The primary always evaluates as true; it sets  the
               permissions  of  the file to _m_o_d_e.  Octal and sym-
               bolic permissions are accepted for  _m_o_d_e  as  with
               cchhmmoodd(1).

          -cchhoowwnn _u_n_a_m_e
               The primary always evaluates as true; it sets  the
               owner of the file to _u_n_a_m_e.

          -ffaallssee
               The primary always evaluates as false;  it  allows
               to  make  the  result  of the full expression dif-
               ferent from the result of a part  of  the  expres-
               sion.

               The primary always evaluates as true; it allows to
               make  the  result of the full expression different
               from the result of a part of the expression.

          The command line:

          --ttyyppee dd

          lists all directories and puts all  non-directories  to
          the image oo..iissoo.

          The command line:

          mmkkiissooffss --oo oo..iissoo --ffiinndd .. (( --ttyyppee dd --cchhoowwnn rroooott --oo  ttrruuee
          ))

          archives all directories so they appear to be owned  by
          root  in  the archive, all non-directories are archived
          as they are in the file system.

          Note that the -llss, -eexxeecc and the -ookk primary cannot  be
          used if ssttddiinn or stdout has not been redirected.

     -ggiidd _g_i_d
          Overrides the gid read from the  source  files  to  the
          value  of  _g_i_d.   Specifying  this option automatically
          enables Rock Ridge extensions.

     -gguuii Switch the behaviour for a GUI.  This  currently  makes
          the  output  more verbose but may have other effects in
          future.

     -ggrraafftt-ppooiinnttss
          Allow to use graft points for filenames. If this option
          is  used,  all  filenames are checked for graft points.
          The filename is divided at the  first  unescaped  equal
          sign.  All  occurrences of '\\' and '=' characters must
          be escaped with '\\' if -_g_r_a_f_t-_p_o_i_n_t_s has  been  speci-
          fied.

     -hhiiddee _g_l_o_b
          Hide _g_l_o_b from being seen on the ISO-9660 or Rock Ridge
          directory.   _g_l_o_b  is  a  shell wild-card-style pattern
          that must match any part of the filename or path.  Mul-
          tiple  globs  may  be hidden.  If _g_l_o_b matches a direc-
          tory, then the contents of that directory will be  hid-
          den.  In order to match a directory name, make sure the
          pathname does not include  a  trailing  '/'  character.
          All  the hidden files will still be written to the out-
          put  CD  image  file.   Should   be   used   with   the

          above.

     -hhiiddddeenn _g_l_o_b
          Add the hidden (existence) ISO-9660 directory attribute
          for  _g_l_o_b.  This attribute will prevent _g_l_o_b from being
          listed on DOS based systems if the /A flag is not  used
          for  the listing.  _g_l_o_b is a shell wild-card-style pat-
          tern that must match any part of the filename or  path.
          In order to match a directory name, make sure the path-
          name does not include a trailing '/' character.  Multi-
          ple globs may be hidden.

     -hhiiddee-jjoolliieett _g_l_o_b
          Hide _g_l_o_b from being  seen  on  the  Joliet  directory.
          _g_l_o_b is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match
          any part of the filename or path.  Multiple  globs  may
          be  hidden.  If _g_l_o_b matches a directory, then the con-
          tents of that directory will be hidden.   In  order  to
          match a directory name, make sure the pathname does not
          include a trailing '/' character.  All the hidden files
          will  still  be  written  to  the output CD image file.
          Should be used with the -hhiiddee option.  See  README.hide

          above.

     -hhiiddee-jjoolliieett-ttrraannss-ttbbll
          Hide the TTRRAANNSS..TTBBLL files from the Joliet  tree.   These
          files  usually  don't make sense in the Joliet World as
          they list the real name and the ISO-9660 name which may
          both be different from the Joliet name.

     -hhiiddee-rrrr-mmoovveedd
          Rename the directory RRRR__MMOOVVEEDD to ..rrrr__mmoovveedd in the  Rock
          Ridge  tree.   It  seems to be impossible to completely
          hide the RRRR__MMOOVVEEDD directory from the Rock  Ridge  tree.
          This  option  only  makes  the  visible  tree better to
          understand for people who don't know what  this  direc-
          tory is for.  If you need to have no RRRR__MMOOVVEEDD directory
          at all, you should use the -DD option. Note that in case
          that  the  -DD  option has been specified, the resulting
          filesystem is not ISO-9660 level-1 compliant  and  will
          not  be readable on MS-DOS.  See also NNOOTTEESS section for

          1:1  mapping,  you  may use ddeeffaauulltt as charset name. If
          the input charset has not been set up from  the  locale
          in  the  environment,  the  default  initial values are
          _c_p_4_3_7 on DOS based systems and _i_s_o_8_8_5_9-_1 on  all  other

          With all ISO-9660 levels from 1..3, all  filenames  are
          restricted  to  upper  case  letters,  numbers  and the
          underscore (_). The maximum  filename  length  is  res-
          tricted  to  31 characters, the directory nesting level
          is restricted to 8 and the maximum path length is  lim-
          ited to 255 characters.

          Level 4 officially does not exists but mmkkiissooffss maps  it
          to ISO-9660:1999 which is ISO-9660 version 2.

          With level 4, an enhanced volume descriptor  with  ver-
          sion  number and file structure version number set to 2
          is emitted.  There may be more than 8 levels of  direc-
          tory  nesting, there is no need for a file to contain a
          dot and the dot has no more special meaning, file names
          do  not  have  version  numbers, the maximum length for
          files and directory is raised to 207.  If Rock Ridge is
          used,  the  maximum  ISO-9660 name length is reduced to
          197.

          When  creating  Version  2  images,  mmkkiissooffss  emits  an
          enhanced  volume  descriptor  which  looks similar to a
          primary volume descriptor but is slightly different. Be
          careful  not  to  use  broken software to make ISO-9660

          CD's that use only Joliet extensions  but  no  standard
          Rock  Ridge  extensions  may  usually  only  be used on
          Microsoft Win32 systems. Furthermore, the fact that the
          filenames  are  limited  to  64 characters and the fact
          that Joliet uses the UTF-16 coding for Unicode  charac-
          ters causes interoperability problems.

     -jjoolliieett-lloonngg
          Allow Joliet filenames to be up to 103 Unicode  charac-
          ters.  This  breaks  the  Joliet  specification  -  but
          appears to work. Use with caution. The  number  103  is
          derived  from:  the  maximum  Directory  Record  Length
          (254), minus the length of Directory Record (33), minus
          CD-ROM   XA  System  Use  Extension  Information  (14),
          divided by the UTF-16 character size (2).

     -ll   Allow full 31 character filenames.  Normally  the  ISO-
          9660  filename will be in an 8.3 format which is compa-
          tible with MS-DOS, even though  the  ISO-9660  standard
          allows  filenames  of  up to 31 characters.  If you use
          this option, the disc may be difficult to use on a  MS-
          DOS  system, but this comes in handy on some other sys-
          tems (such as the Amiga).  Use with caution.

     -LL   Outdated   option   reserved   by   POSIX.1-2001,   use
          -aallllooww-lleeaaddiinngg-ddoottss  instead.   This  option  will  get
          POSIX.1-2001 semantics with mkisofs-2.02.

     -lloogg-ffiillee _l_o_g__f_i_l_e
          Redirect all error, warning and informational  messages
          to _l_o_g__f_i_l_e instead of the standard error.

     -mm _g_l_o_b
          Exclude _g_l_o_b from being written to CDROM.   _g_l_o_b  is  a
          shell  wild-card-style  pattern that must match part of
          the filename (not the path as with option -xx).  Techni-
          cally _g_l_o_b is matched against the _d->_d__n_a_m_e part of the
          directory  entry.   Multiple  globs  may  be  excluded.
          Example:

          mkisofs -o rom -m '*.o' -m core -m foobar

          would exclude all files ending in ".o",  called  "core"
          or "foobar" to be copied to CDROM. Note that if you had
          a directory called "foobar" it too (and of  course  all
          its descendants) would be excluded.

          NOTE: The -mm and -xx option description should  both  be
          updated,  they  are wrong.  Both now work identical and
          use filename globbing. A file is excluded if either the
          last component matches or the whole path matches.

     -eexxcclluuddee-lliisstt _f_i_l_e
          A file containing a list of  _g_l_o_b_s  to  be  exclude  as
          above.

     -mmaaxx-IISSOO--99666600-ffiilleennaammeess
          Allow 37 chars  in  ISO-9660  filenames.   This  option
          forces  the  -NN option as the extra name space is taken
          from the space reserved for ISO-9660 version numbers.
          This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens  to
          work  on  many systems.  Although a conforming applica-
          tion needs to provide a buffer space  of  at  least  37
          characters,  disks created with this option may cause a
          buffer overflow in the reading  operating  system.  Use
          with extreme care.

          or

     -ddeevv _d_e_v_i_c_e
          Specifies path to existing ISO-9660 image to be merged.
          The  alternate  form takes a SCSI device specifier that
          uses the same syntax as the ddeevv== parameter of ccddrreeccoorrdd..
          The  output  of  mmkkiissooffss  will  be  a new session which
          should get written to the end of the image specified in
          -M.   Typically  this requires multi-session capability
          for the recorder and cdrom drive that you are  attempt-
          ing  to  write  this image to.  This option may only be
          used in conjunction with the -CC option.

     -NN   Omit version numbers from ISO-9660 file names.
          This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but no one  really
          uses the version numbers anyway.  Use with caution.

     -nneeww-ddiirr-mmooddee _m_o_d_e
          Mode to use when creating new directories in the iso fs
          image.  The default mode is 0555.

     -nnoobbaakk

     -nnoo-bbaakk
          Do not include  backup  files  files  on  the  ISO-9660
          filesystem.   If the -nnoo-bbaakk option is specified, files
          that contain the characters '~' or '#' or end in '.bak'
          will  not be included (these are typically backup files
          for editors under unix).

     -nnoo-lliimmiitt-ppaatthhttaabblleess
          A ISO-9660 filesystem contains path tables that contain
          a  list  of  directories.   This  list may contain many
          directories but only 65535 of them may be parent direc-
          tories.   When  -nnoo-lliimmiitt-ppaatthhttaabblleess is in use, further
          parent directories will be folded to the root directory
          and  the  resulting filesystem will no longer be usable
          on DDOOSS.

     -ffoorrccee-rrrr
          Do not use the automatic Rock Ridge attributes recogni-

          Don't split the SL components, but  begin  a  new  Con-
          tinuation Area (CE) instead. This may waste some space,
          but the SunOS 4.1.4 cdrom driver has a bug  in  reading
          split SL components (link_size = component_size instead
          of link_size += component_size).

          Note that this  option  has  been  introduced  by  Eric
          Youngdale in 1997.  It is questionable whether it makes
          sense at all.  When it has been introduced, mmkkiissooffss did
          have  a serious bug that did create defective CE signa-
          tures if a symlink contained `/../'.  This CE signature
          bug in mmkkiissooffss has been fixed in May 2003.

          SunOS 4.1.4 and Solaris 2.5.1 cdrom driver have  a  bug
          in reading split SL fields (a `/' can be dropped).

          Note that this  option  has  been  introduced  by  Eric

     -oo _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
          is the name of the file to which the ISO-9660  filesys-
          tem  image should be written.  This can be a disk file,
          a tape drive, or it can correspond directly to the dev-
          ice name of the optical disc writer.  If not specified,
          stdout is used.  Note that the output  can  also  be  a
          block special device for a regular disk drive, in which
          case the disk partition can be mounted and examined  to
          ensure that the premastering was done correctly.

     -ppaadd Pad the end of the whole image by 150 sectors (300 kB).
          If  the  option  -BB is used, then there is a padding at
          the end of the ISO-9660 partition and before the begin-
          ning  of the boot partitions.  The size of this padding
          is chosen to make the first boot partition start  on  a
          sector number that is a multiple of 16.

          The padding is needed as many operating  systems  (e.g.
          Linux)  implement  read  ahead bugs in their filesystem
          I/O. These bugs result in read errors on  one  or  more
          files  that are located at the end of a track. They are
          usually present when the CD is written in Track at Once
          mode or when the disk is written as mixed mode CD where

          an audio track follows the data track.

          To avoid problems with I/O error on the  last  file  on
          the  filesystem,  the  -ppaadd  option  has  been made the
          default.

     -nnoo-ppaadd
          Do not Pad the end by 150 sectors (300 kB) and  do  not
          make  the the boot partitions start on a multiple of 16
          sectors.

     -ppaatthh-lliisstt _f_i_l_e
          A file containing a list of  _p_a_t_h_s_p_e_c  directories  and
          filenames  to be added to the ISO-9660 filesystem. This
          list of pathspecs are processed after any  that  appear
          on  the  command  line.  If the argument is -, then the
          list is read from the standard input.

          the CDROM, usually with a  mailing  address  and  phone
          number.   There is space on the disc for 128 characters
          of information.  The related Joliet entry is limited to
          64  characters.   This parameter can also be set in the
          file ..mmkkiissooffssrrcc  with  PUBL=.   If  specified  in  both
          places, the command line version is used.

     -pp _p_r_e_p_a_r_e_r__i_d
          Specifies a text string that will be written  into  the

          the CDROM, usually with a  mailing  address  and  phone
          number.   There is space on the disc for 128 characters
          of information.  The related Joliet entry is limited to

          will be entered using Rock Ridge if enabled,  otherwise

     -ppoossiixx-PP
          Do  not  follow  symbolic  links  when  generating  the

          specified after -ppoossiixx-HH or  -ppoossiixx-LL,  the  effect  of
          these options will be reset.

          Print estimated filesystem size  in  multiples  of  the
          sector  size  (2048  bytes)  and  exit.  This option is
          needed for Disk At Once mode and with some CD-R  drives
          when  piping directly into ccddrreeccoorrdd.. In this case it is
          needed to know the size of the  filesystem  before  the
          actual  CD-creation  is  done.   The option -print-size
          allows to get this size from a "dry-run" before the  CD
          is actually written.  Old versions of mmkkiissooffss did write
          this information (among other information)  to  _s_t_d_e_r_r.
          As  this  turns  out  to  be  hard to parse, the number
          without any other information is now printed on  ssttddoouutt
          too.   If  you  like  to  write  a simple shell script,
          redirect ssttddeerrrr and catch the number from ssttddoouutt.  This
          may be done with:

     -qquuiieett
          This makes mmkkiissooffss even less verbose.  No progress out-
          put will be provided.

     -RR   Generate SUSP and RR records using the Rock Ridge  pro-
          tocol  to  further  describe  the files on the ISO-9660
          filesystem.  The Rock Ridge protocol is needed in order
          to  add  POSIX  like  file  meta data like permissions,
          extended time stamps,  user/group  is'd,  link  counts,
          inode numbers and symbolic links. The Rock Ridge proto-
          col allows to archive hierarchy  trees  with  unlimited
          depth.

     -rr   This is like the -R  option,  but  file  ownership  and
          modes  are  set to more useful values.  The uid and gid
          are set to zero, because they are usually  only  useful
          on  the  author's system, and not useful to the client.
          All the file read bits are set true, so that files  and
          directories  are  globally  readable on the client.  If
          any execute bit is set for a file, set all of the  exe-
          cute  bits, so that executables are globally executable
          on the client.  If any search bit is set for  a  direc-
          tory,  set  all of the search bits, so that directories
          are globally searchable on the client.  All write  bits
          are  cleared,  because the CD-Rom will be mounted read-
          only in any case.  If any of the special mode bits  are

          set, clear them, because file locks are not useful on a
          read-only file system, and set-id bits are  not  desir-
          able  for uid 0 or gid 0.  When used on Win32, the exe-
          cute bit is set on _a_l_l files. This is a result  of  the
          lack  of file permissions on Win32 and the Cygwin POSIX
          emulation  layer.   See  also  -uid  -gid,   -dir-mode,
          -file-mode and -new-dir-mode.

     -rreellaaxxeedd-ffiilleennaammeess
          The option -rreellaaxxeedd-ffiilleennaammeess allows ISO-9660 filenames
          to  include digits, upper case characters and all other
          7 bit ASCII characters (resp. anything except lowercase
          characters).
          This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens  to
          work on many systems.  Use with caution.

     -rroooott _d_i_r
          Moves all files and directories into _d_i_r in the  image.
          This is essentially the same as using --ggrraafftt--ppooiinnttss and
          adding _d_i_r in front of every pathspec, but is easier to
          use.

          _d_i_r may actually be several levels deep. It is  created
          with the same permissions as other graft points.

     -rrrriipp111100
          Create ISO-9660 file system images that follow the  old
          Rrip  Version-1.10  standard from 1993. This option may
          be needed if you know of systems that do not  implement
          the Rrip protocol correctly and like the file system to

          known.

          If a file system has been created  with  -rrrriipp111100,  the
          Rock  Ridge  attributes  do  not  include  inode number
          information.

     -rrrriipp111122
          Create ISO-9660 file system images that follow the  new

     -oolldd--rroooott _d_i_r
          This option is necessary when  writing  a  multisession
          image  and  the  previous  (or  even older) session was
          written with --rroooott _d_i_r.  Using  a  directory  name  not
          found  in  the previous session causes mmkkiissooffss to abort
          with an error.

          Without this option, mmkkiissooffss would not be able to  find
          unmodified  files  and  would  be forced to write their
          data into the image once more.

          -rroooott and -oolldd--rroooott are meant to be used together to do
          incremental  backups.   The  initial session would e.g.
          use:  mmkkiissooffss -rroooott bbaacckkuupp__11 _d_i_r_s.  The next  incremen-

          bbaacckkuupp__11 _d_i_r_s.  would take another  snapshot  of  these
          directories.  The  first  snapshot  would  be  found in
          bbaacckkuupp__11, the second one in bbaacckkuupp__22, but only modified
          or  new  files  need to be written into the second ses-
          sion.

          Without these options, new files would be added and old
          ones   would  be  preserved.  But  old  ones  would  be
          overwritten if the file was  modified.  Recovering  the
          files by copying the whole directory back from CD would
          also restore files  that  were  deleted  intentionally.
          Accessing  several  older  versions  of a file requires
          support by the operating system to  choose  which  ses-
          sions are to be mounted.

          the  ISO-9660  filesystem.   The _s_e_c_t_o_r _t_y_p_e may be one

          ddaattaa This is the default. It results in standard CD-ROM
               data sectors with 2048 bytes per sector.

          xxaa11  This sets the sector type to CD-ROM XA mode 1 with
               2056  bytes  per  sector.  This sector type is the
               official sector type  for  multi-session  CDs,  it
               should  be  used  together  with the -XXAA option of
               mkisofs.  It is required to write Kodak Photo  CDs
               and  Kodak  Picture CDs.  Use the -xxaa11 option from
               ccddrreeccoorrdd to tell ccddrreeccoorrdd to write CD-ROM XA  mode
               1 sectors.  Do not use for DVD or BluRay media.

          rraaww  This sets the sector type  to  raw  audio  sectors
               with  2352 bytes per sector.  This is reserved for
               future enhancements.  Do not use for DVD or BluRay
               media.

     -ssoorrtt _s_o_r_t _f_i_l_e
          Sort file locations on the media. Sorting is controlled
          by  a file that contains pairs of filenames and sorting
          offset weighting.  If the weighting is higher, the file
          will  be  located closer to the beginning of the media,
          if the weighting is lower, the  file  will  be  located
          closer  to the end of the media. There must be only one
          space or tabs character between the  filename  and  the
          weight  and the weight must be the last characters on a

          ters  up  to,  but  not including the last space or tab
          character on a line. This is to allow for space charac-
          ters  to  be  in,  or  at  the end of a filename.  This
          option does nnoott sort the order of the file  names  that
          appear in the ISO-9660 directory. It sorts the order in
          which the file data is written to the CD image -  which
          may be useful in order to optimize the data layout on a
          CD. See README.sort for more details.

     -sspplliitt-oouuttppuutt
          Split the output image into several files  of  approxi-
          mately  1  GB.  This helps to create DVD sized ISO-9660
          images on operating systems without large file support.
          Cdrecord  will  concatenate  more  than one file into a
          single  track  if  writing   to   a   DVD.    To   make

          specified. The resulting output images will  be  named:
          _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e__0_0,_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e__0_1,filename_02...

          Select streaming operation and set the media size to  #
          sectors.  This allows you to pipe the output of the tar
          program into mkisofs and to create a ISO-9660  filesys-
          tem  without  the  need  of an intermediate tar archive
          file. If this option has been specified, mmkkiissooffss  reads
          from ssttddiinn and creates a file with the name SSTTRREEAAMM..IIMMGG.
          The maximum size of the file (with padding) is 200 sec-
          tors less than the specified media size. If -nnoo-ppaadd has
          been specified, the file size is 50 sectors  less  than
          the specified media size.  If the file is smaller, then
          mkisofs will write padding. This may take a while.

          The option -ssttrreeaamm-mmeeddiiaa-ssiizzee creates  simple  ISO-9660
          filesystems  only and may not used together with multi-

          value  different  from  SSTTRREEAAMM..IIMMGG.   If this option is

          that  are  needed to make a bootable CD for Solaris x86
          systems.

          Note that partition 1 is used for  the  ISO-9660  image
          and  that partition 2 is the whole disk, so partition 1
          and 2 may not be used by external partition data.   The
          first  image  file is mapped to partition 0.  There may
          be empty fields in the comma separated list,  and  list
          entries  for partition 1 and 2 must be empty.  The max-
          imum number of supported partitions is 8 (although  the
          Solaris x86 partition table could support up to 16 par-
          titions), so it is impossible to specify  more  than  6
          partition  images.   This  option is required to make a
          bootable CD for Solaris x86 systems.

          If the -ssuunnxx8866-bboooott  option  has  been  specified,  the
          first  sector  of the resulting image will contain a PC
          fdisk label with a Solaris type  0x82  fdisk  partition
          that  starts  at offset 512 and spans the whole CD.  In
          addition, for the Solaris type  0x82  fdisk  partition,
          there  is a SVr4 disk label at offset 1024 in the first
          sector of the CD.  This disk label  specifies  slice  0
          for  the first (usually UFS type) filesystem image that
          is used to boot the PC and slice  1  for  the  ISO-9660
          image.   Slice 2 spans the whole CD slice 3 ... slice 7
          may be used for additional filesystem images that  have
          been specified with this option.

          A Solaris x86 boot CD uses a 1024  byte  sized  primary
          boot that uses the EEll--TToorriittoo nnoo--eemmuullaattiioonn boot mode and
          a secondary generic boot that is in CD  sectors  1..15.
          For this reason, both --bb _b_o_o_t_i_m_a_g_e --nnoo-eemmuull-bboooott and -GG
          _g_e_n_b_o_o_t must be specified.

     -ssuunnxx8866-llaabbeell _l_a_b_e_l
          Set the SVr4 disk label name for the  SVr4  disk  label
          that is created with the -ssuunnxx8866--bboooott option.

     -ssyyssiidd _I_D
          Specifies the system ID.  There is space  on  the  disc
          for  32  characters of information.  This parameter can
          also be set in the file ..mmkkiissooffssrrcc with SYSI=system_id.
          If  specified  in both places, the command line version
          is used.

     -TT   Generate a file TRANS.TBL  in  each  directory  on  the
          CDROM, which can be used on non-Rock Ridge capable sys-
          tems to help establish the correct file  names.   There
          is  also information present in the file that indicates
          the major and minor numbers  for  block  and  character
          devices, and each symlink has the name of the link file
          given.

          Alternative translation table file  name  (see  above).
          Implies  the  -TT  option.  If you are creating a multi-

          vious session.

     -uuccss-lleevveell _l_e_v_e_l
          Set Unicode conformance level in the  Joliet  SVD.  The
          default  level  is 3.  It may be set to 1..3 using this
          option.

     -UUDDFF Include a UUDDFF hybrid in the generated filesystem image.
          As  mmkkiissooffss always creates a ISO-9660 filesystem, it is
          not possible to create UDF only images. Note  that  UUDDFF
          wastes  the  space from sector ~20 to sector 256 at the
          beginning of the disk in addition to the  spcae  needed
          for real UUDDFF data structures.

     -uuddff Rationalized UDF with user and group set to 0 and  with
          simplified  permissions.  See -rr option for more infor-
          mation.

     -uuddff-ssyymmlliinnkkss
          Support  symlinks  in  UUDDFF  filesystems.  This  is  the
          default.

     -nnoo-uuddff-ssyymmlliinnkkss
          Do not support symlinks in UUDDFF filesystems.

          Overrides the uid read from the  source  files  to  the
          value  of  _u_i_d.   Specifying  this option automatically
          enables Rock Ridge extensions.

     -uussee-ffiilleevveerrssiioonn
          The option -uussee-ffiilleevveerrssiioonn allows mkisofs to use  file
          version  numbers from the filesystem.  If the option is
          not specified, mmkkiissooffss creates a version  number  of  1
          for  all files.  File versions are strings in the range
          ;_1 to ;_3_2_7_6_7 This option is the default on VMS.

     -UU   Allows "Untranslated" filenames,  completely  violating
          the  ISO-9660  standards described above. Forces on the
          -d, -l,  -N,  -allow-leading-dots,  -relaxed-filenames,
          -allow-lowercase, -allow-multidot and -no-iso-translate
          flags. It allows more than one  '.'  character  in  the
          filename,  as  well  as  mixed case filenames.  This is
          useful  on  HP-UX  system,  where  the  built-in   CDFS
          filesystem  does not recognize ANY extensions. Use with
          extreme caution.

     -VV _v_o_l_i_d
          Specifies the volume ID (volume name or  label)  to  be

          disc for 32 characters of information.  This  parameter
          can  also  be  set in the file ..mmkkiissooffssrrcc with VOLI=id.
          If specified in both places, the command  line  version
          is  used.  Note that if you assign a volume ID, this is
          the name that will be used as the mount point  used  by
          the  Solaris volume management system and the name that
          is assigned to the disc on a Microsoft Win32  or  Apple
          Mac platform.

     -vvoollsseett _I_D

          entry is limited to 64 characters.  This parameter  can
          also be set in the file ..mmkkiissooffssrrcc with VOLS=volset_id.
          If specified in both places, the command  line  version

          volume set is a collection of one or more  volumes,  on
          which a set of files is recorded.

          Volume Sets are not intended to be used to create a set
          numbered  CD's that are part of e.g. a Operation System
          installation set of CD's.  Volume Sets are rather  used
          to  record a big directory tree that would not fit on a
          single volume.  Each volume of a Volume Set contains  a
          description  of  all the directories and files that are

          the pathname given as command  line  argument  and  the
          path relative to this directory.  Multiple paths may be
          excluded.  Example:

          mkisofs -o cd -x /local/dir1 -x /local/dir2 /local

          NOTE: The -mm and -xx option description should  both  be
          updated,  they  are wrong.  Both now work identical and
          use filename globbing. A file is excluded if either the
          last component matches or the whole path matches.

     -XXAA  Generate  XA  iso-directory  attributes  with  original
          owner and mode information.  This option is required to
          create conforming multi session  CDs  as  used  by  the
          Kodak  Photo CD and the Kodak Picture CD.  A conforming
          XA CD uses CD-ROM XA mode 1 sectors,  see  the  -sseeccttoorr
          _x_a_2 option for more information.

     -xxaa  Generate XA iso-directory attributes with  rationalized

          set to 0.  See -XXAA for more information.

     -zz   Generate  special  RRIP   records   for   transparently
          compressed files.  This is only of use and interest for
          hosts that support transparent decompression,  such  as
          Linux  2.4.14  or later.  You must specify the -RR or -rr
          options to enable RockRidge,  and  generate  compressed
          files   using   the  mmkkzzffttrreeee  utility  before  running
          mmkkiissooffss.  Note that transparent compression is  a  non-
          standard Rock Ridge extension.  The resulting disks are
          only transparently readable if used on Linux.  On other
          operating  systems  you  will  need to call mmkkzzffttrreeee by
          hand to decompress the files.

          Create an ISO-9660 CD with Apple's extensions.  Similar
          to the -hhffss option, except that the Apple Extensions to
          ISO-9660 are added instead of creating  an  HFS  hybrid
          volume.  Former mmkkiissooffss versions did include Rock Ridge
          attributes by default if  -aappppllee  was  specified.  This
          versions  of  mmkkiissooffss  does not do this anymore. If you

     mmkkiissooffss processes file names in a  POSIX  compliant  way  as
     strings  of  8-bit characters.  To represent all codings for
     all languages, 8-bit characters are not sufficient.  Unicode
     or  IISSOO--1100664466 define character codings that need at least 21
     bits  to  represent  all  known  languages.  They   may   be
     represented  with  UUTTFF--3322,  UUTTFF--1166  or UUTTFF--88 coding.  UUTTFF--3322
     uses a plain 32-bit coding but seems to be  uncommon.  UUCCSS--22
     is  used by Microsoft with Win32.  This coding is similar to
     UUTTFF--1166 with the disadvantage that it only supports a 16  bit
     subset  of all codes and that 16-bit characters are not com-
     pliant with the POSIX filesystem interface.

     Modern UNIX operating  systems  may  use  UUTTFF--88  coding  for
     filenames.  This  coding  allows to use the complete Unicode
     code set.  Each 32-bit character is represented  by  one  or
     more  8-bit  characters.   If  a  character is coded in IISSOO--
     88885599--11 (used in Central Europe and North  America)  is  maps
     1:1  to  a  UUTTFF--3322  or UUTTFF--1166 coded Unicode character.  If a
     character is coded in 77--BBiitt AASSCCIIII (used  in  USA  and  other
     countries  with limited character set) is maps 1:1 to a UUTTFF--
     3322, UUTTFF--1166 or  UUTTFF--88  coded  Unicode  character.   Character
     codes  that  cannot be represented as a single byte in UTF-8
     (typically if the value is > 0x7F) use escape sequences that
     map to more than one 8-bit character.

     If all operating systems would  use  UUTTFF--88  coding,  mmkkiissooffss
     would  not  need to recode characters in file names.  Unfor-
     tunately, Apple  uses  completely  nonstandard  codings  and
     Microsoft  uses a Unicode coding that is not compatible with
     the POSIX filename interface.

     For all non UUTTFF--88 coded operating systems, the actual  char-
     acter that each byte represents depends on the _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _s_e_t
     or _c_o_d_e_p_a_g_e (which is the name used by  Microsoft)  used  by
     the  local  operating  system  in  use - the characters in a
     character set will reflect the region  or  natural  language
     used by the user.

     Usually character codes 0x00-0x1f  are  control  characters,
     codes  0x20-0x7f are the 7 bit ASCII characters and (on PC's

     and Mac's) 0x80-0xff are used for other characters.   Unfor-
     tunately  even  this  does  not  follow  ISO  standards that
     reserve the range 0x80-0x9f for control characters and  only
     allow 0xa0-0xff for other characters.

     As there is a lot more than 256 characters/symbols  in  use,
     only  a  small  subset  are  represented in a character set.
     Therefore the same character code may represent a  different
     character  in  different character sets. So a file name gen-
     erated, say in central Europe,  may  not  display  the  same
     character when viewed on a machine in, say eastern Europe.

     To make matters more complicated, different  operating  sys-
     tems   use  different  character  sets  for  the  region  or
     language. For example the character code for "small  e  with
     acute  accent" may be character code 0x82 on a PC, code 0x8e
     on a Macintosh and code 0xe9 on a UNIX system.   Note  while
     the  codings  used  on  a PC or Mac are nonstandard, Unicode
     codes this character as 0x00000000e9 which is basically  the
     same value as the value used by most UNIX systems.

     As long as not all operating systems and  applications  will
     use the Unicode character set as the basis for file names in
     a unique way, it may be necessary to specify which character
     set  your file names use in and which character set the file
     names should appear on the CD.

     There are four options to specify  the  character  sets  you
     want to use:

     -input-charset
          Defines the local character set you are using  on  your
          host  machine.  Any character set conversions that take
          place will use this character set as the staring point.
          The default input character sets are _c_p_4_3_7 on DOS based
          systems and _i_s_o_8_8_5_9-_1 on all other systems.

          If the -_J option is given, then the Unicode equivalents
          of  the  input character set will be used in the Joliet
          directory. Using the -_j_c_h_a_r_s_e_t option is  the  same  as
          using the -_i_n_p_u_t-_c_h_a_r_s_e_t and -_J options.

     -output-charset
          Defines the character set that will be  used  with  for
          the  Rock  Ridge names on the CD. Defaults to the input
          character set. Only likely to be useful if  used  on  a
          non-Unix  platform.  e.g.  using mmkkiissooffss on a Microsoft
          Win32 machine to create Rock  Ridge  CDs.  If  you  are
          using  mmkkiissooffss on a Unix machine, it is likely that the
          output character set will be  the  same  as  the  input
          character set.

     -input-hfs-charset
          Defines the HFS character set used for HFS  file  names
          decoded  from  any  of the various Apple/Unix file for-
          mats. Only useful when used with -_m_a_c-_n_a_m_e option.  See
          the  HHFFSS  MMAACCIINNTTOOSSHH  FFIILLEE  NNAAMMEESS  for more information.
          Defaults to _c_p_1_0_0_0_0 (Mac Roman).

     -output-hfs-charset
          Defines the HFS character set used to create  HFS  file
          names  from  the  input  character  set in use. In most
          cases this will be from the character  set  given  with
          the  -_i_n_p_u_t-_c_h_a_r_s_e_t  option.  Defaults to the input HFS
          character set.

     There are a number of character sets built  in  to  _m_k_i_s_o_f_s.
     To get a listing, use mmkkiissooffss -iinnppuutt-cchhaarrsseett hheellpp..

     Additional character sets from iiccoonnvv(1) may be used on  sys-
     tems, that support iiccoonnvv(1).  In this case, call iiccoonnvv -ll to
     get a list of valid character sets from this coding  method.
     To force an iiccoonnvv(1) based coding, use iiccoonnvv::_n_a_m_e instead of
     _n_a_m_e for the character set.

     If using non iiccoonnvv(1) based character sets, additional char-
     acter  sets  can  be read from file for any of the character
     set options by giving a filename  as  the  argument  to  the
     options.  The  given file will only be read if its name does
     not match one of the built in character sets.

     The format of the character set files is  the  same  as  the
     mapping            files            available           from
     http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS The format  of  these
     files is:

          Column #1 is the input byte code (in hex as 0xXX)
          Column #2 is the Unicode (in hex as 0xXXXX)
          Rest of the line is ignored.

     Any blank line, line without two (or more)  columns  in  the
     above  format or comments lines (starting with the # charac-
     ter) are ignored without any  warnings.  Any  missing  input
     code is mapped to Unicode character 0x0000.

     Note that there is no support for 16 bit UNICODE (UTF-16) or
     32  bit  UNICODE  (UTF-32) coding because this coding is not
     POSIX compliant. There should be support for  UTF-8  UNICODE
     coding  which is compatible to POSIX filenames and supported
     by moder UNIX implementations such as Solaris.

     A 1:1 character set mapping can be defined by using the key-
     word  _d_e_f_a_u_l_t  as  the  argument to any of the character set
     options. This is the behaviour of older (v1.12) versions  of

     mmkkiissooffss.

     The ISO-9660 file names generated from the  input  filenames
     are not converted from the input character set. The ISO-9660
     character set is a very limited subset of the ASCII  charac-
     ters, so any conversion would be pointless.

     Any character that mmkkiissooffss can not convert will be  replaced
     with a '_' character.

HHFFSS CCRREEAATTOORR//TTYYPPEE
     A Macintosh file has two properties associated with it which
     define  which  application created the file, the _C_R_E_A_T_O_R and
     what data the file contains, the _T_Y_P_E.  Both are (exactly) 4
     letter  strings.  Usually  this  allows  a Macintosh user to
     double-click on a file and launch  the  correct  application
     etc.  The CREATOR and TYPE of a particular file can be found
     by using something like ResEdit (or similar) on a Macintosh.

     The CREATOR and TYPE information is stored in all the  vari-
     ous  Apple/Unix encoded files.  For other files it is possi-
     ble to base the CREATOR and TYPE on the filename's extension
     using  a  _m_a_p_p_i_n_g  file  (the  -mmaapp option) and/or using the
     _m_a_g_i_c _n_u_m_b_e_r (usually a _s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e in the first few bytes) of
     a file (the -mmaaggiicc option). If both these options are given,
     then their order on the command line is  important.  If  the
     -mmaapp  option is given first, then a filename extension match
     is attempted before a magic number match.  However,  if  the
     -mmaaggiicc  option  is given first, then a magic number match is
     attempted before a filename extension match.

     If a mapping or magic file is not used, or no match is found
     then  the default CREATOR and TYPE for all regular files can
     be set by using entries in the ..mmkkiissooffssrrcc file or using  the
     -hhffss-ccrreeaattoorr and/or -hhffss-ttyyppee options, otherwise the default
     CREATOR and TYPE are 'unix' and 'TEXT'.

     The format of the _m_a_p_p_i_n_g file is the same _a_f_p_f_i_l_e format as
     used by _a_u_f_s.  This file has five columns for the _e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n,
     _f_i_l_e _t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_i_o_n, _C_R_E_A_T_O_R, _T_Y_P_E and _C_o_m_m_e_n_t.  Lines starting
     with the '#' character are comment lines and are ignored. An
     example file would be like:

     # Example filename mapping file
     #
     # EXTN   XLate   CREATOR   TYPE     Comment

     Where:

          The first column _E_X_T_N defines the Unix filename  exten-
          sion to be mapped. The default mapping for any filename
          extension that doesn't match is defined  with  the  "*"
          character.

          The _X_l_a_t_e column defines the type of  text  translation
          between  the  Unix  and Macintosh file it is ignored by
          mmkkiissooffss, but is kept to  be  compatible  with  aauuffss(1).
          Although mmkkiissooffss does not alter the contents of a file,
          if a binary file has its TYPE set as 'TEXT', it _m_a_y  be
          read  incorrectly  on  a  Macintosh. Therefore a better
          choice for the default TYPE may be '????'

          The _C_R_E_A_T_O_R and _T_Y_P_E keywords must be 4 characters long
          and enclosed in single quotes.

          The comment field is enclosed in double quotes - it  is
          ignored  by  mmkkiissooffss, but is kept to be compatible with
          aauuffss.

     The format of the _m_a_g_i_c file  is  almost  identical  to  the
     mmaaggiicc(4)  file  used by the Linux ffiillee(1) command - the rou-
     tines for reading and decoding the _m_a_g_i_c file are  based  on
     the Linux ffiillee(1) command.

     This file has  four  tab  separated  columns  for  the  _b_y_t_e
     _o_f_f_s_e_t, _t_y_p_e, _t_e_s_t and _m_e_s_s_a_g_e.  Lines starting with the '#'
     character are comment lines and are ignored. An example file
     would be like:

     # Example magic file
     #
     # off   type      test       message
     0       string    GIF8       8BIM GIFf  GIF image

     4       string    mdat       txtt MooV  QuickTime movie file (mdat)

     The format of the file is  described  in  the  mmaaggiicc(4)  man
     page. The only difference here is that for each entry in the
     magic file, the _m_e_s_s_a_g_e for the initial  offset  mmuusstt  be  4
     characters  for the CREATOR followed by 4 characters for the
     TYPE - white space is optional between them. Any other char-
     acters on this line are ignored.  Continuation lines (start-
     ing with a '>') are  also  ignored  i.e.  only  the  initial

     offset lines are used.

     Using the -mmaaggiicc option may significantly increase  process-
     ing  time  as  each  file has to opened and read to find its
     magic number.

     In summary, for all files, the default CREATOR is 'unix' and
     the  default  TYPE is 'TEXT'.  These can be changed by using
     entries in the ._m_k_i_s_o_f_s_r_c file or by using the  -hhffss-ccrreeaattoorr
     and/or -hhffss-ttyyppee options.

     If the a file is in one of the known Apple/Unix formats (and
     the format has been selected), then the CREATOR and TYPE are
     taken from the values stored in the Apple/Unix file.

     Other files can have their CREATOR and TYPE set  from  their
     file name extension (the -mmaapp option), or their magic number
     (the -mmaaggiicc option). If the default match  is  used  in  the
     _m_a_p_p_i_n_g file, then these values override the default CREATOR
     and TYPE.

     A   full   CREATOR/TYPE   database   can   be    found    at

     Macintosh files have two parts called the _D_a_t_a and  _R_e_s_o_u_r_c_e
     fork.  Either  may  be  empty. Unix (and many other OSs) can
     only cope with files having one part (or fork).  To  add  to
     this, Macintosh files have a number of attributes associated
     with them - probably the most important  are  the  TYPE  and
     CREATOR.  Again Unix has no concept of these types of attri-
     butes.

     e.g. a Macintosh file may be a JPEG image where the image is
     stored  in  the  Data fork and a desktop thumbnail stored in
     the Resource fork. It is usually the information in the data
     fork that is useful across platforms.

     Therefore to store a Macintosh file on a Unix filesystem,  a
     way has to be found to cope with the two forks and the extra
     attributes (which are  referred  to  as  the  _f_i_n_d_e_r  _i_n_f_o).
     Unfortunately,  it  seems  that  every software package that
     stores Macintosh files on Unix has chosen a completely  dif-
     ferent storage method.

     The Apple/Unix formats  that  _m_k_i_s_o_f_s  (partially)  supports
     are:

     CAP AUFS format
          Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in  subdirec-

          info in .finderinfo subdirectory with same filename.

     AppleDouble/Netatalk
          Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored  in  a
          file with same name prefixed with "%". Finder info also
          stored in same "%" file. Netatalk uses the same format,
          but the resource fork/finderinfo stored in subdirectory
          .AppleDouble with same name as data fork.

     AppleSingle
          Data structures similar to above, except both forks and
          finder info are stored in one file.

     Helios EtherShare
          Data fork stored in a file. Resource  fork  and  finder
          info  together in subdirectory .rsrc with same filename
          as data fork.

     IPT UShare
          Very similar to the EtherShare format, but  the  finder
          info is stored slightly differently.

     MacBinary
          Both forks and finder info stored in one file.

     Apple PC Exchange
          Used by Macintoshes to store Apple files on  DOS  (FAT)
          disks.   Data  fork  stored in a file. Resource fork in
          subdirectory  resource.frk  (or  RESOURCE.FRK).  Finder
          info  as one record in file finder.dat (or FINDER.DAT).
          Separate finder.dat for each data fork directory.

          Note: _m_k_i_s_o_f_s needs to know the native FAT cluster size
          of  the disk that the PC Exchange files are on (or have
          been  copied  from).  This  size  is   given   by   the
          -cclluusstteerr-ssiizzee  option.   The cluster or allocation size
          can be found by using the DOS utility CCHHKKDDSSKK.

          May not work with PC  Exchange  v2.2  or  higher  files
          (available  with  MacOS  8.1).  DOS media containing PC
          Exchange files should be mounted  as  type  mmssddooss  (not
          vvffaatt) when using Linux.

     SGI/XINET
          Used by SGI machines when they mount  HFS  disks.  Data
          fork  stored  in  a file. Resource fork in subdirectory
          .HSResource with same name. Finder info as  one  record
          in  file  .HSancillary.  Separate .HSancillary for each
          data fork directory.

          Unfortunately, these private Unicode characters are not
          readable  by  the  mkisofs NT executable. Therefore any

          to  a  non-HFS  file  system  (e.g. UFS, NFS etc.), the
          files are stored  in  AppleDouble  format.   Data  fork
          stored  in  a file. Resource fork stored in a file with
          same name prefixed with "._". Finder info  also  stored
          in same "._" file.

     MacOS X HFS (Alpha)
          Not really an Apple/Unix encoding, but actual  HFS/HFS+
          files  on a MacOS X system. Data fork stored in a file.
          Resource fork stored in a pseudo  file  with  the  same
          name  with  the  suffix '/rsrc'. The finderinfo is only
          available via a MacOS X library call.

          Notes: (also see README.macosx)

          Only works when used on MacOS X.

          If a file is found with a zero length resource fork and
          empty  finderinfo,  it  is  assumed  not  to  have  any
          Apple/Unix encoding - therefore a TYPE and CREATOR  can
          be set using other methods.

     _m_k_i_s_o_f_s will attempt to set the CREATOR, TYPE, date and pos-
     sibly  other flags from the finder info. Additionally, if it
     exists, the Macintosh filename is set from the finder  info,
     otherwise the Macintosh name is based on the Unix filename -
     see the HHFFSS MMAACCIINNTTOOSSHH FFIILLEE NNAAMMEESS section below.

     When using the -aappppllee  option,  the  TYPE  and  CREATOR  are
     stored  in the optional System Use or SUSP field in the ISO-
     9660 Directory Record - in much the same  way  as  the  Rock
     Ridge  attributes  are. In fact to make life easy, the Apple
     extensions are added at the beginning of the  existing  Rock
     Ridge  attributes  (i.e. to get the Apple extensions you get
     the Rock Ridge extensions as well).

     The Apple extensions require the resource fork to be  stored
     as an ISO-9660 _a_s_s_o_c_i_a_t_e_d file. This is just like any normal
     file stored in the ISO-9660 filesystem except that the asso-
     ciated  file  flag  is  set in the Directory Record (bit 2).
     This file has the same name as the data fork (the file  seen
     by   non-Apple  machines).  Associated  files  are  normally
     ignored by other OSs

     When using the -hhffss option, the TYPE and CREATOR plus  other
     finder  info,  are  stored  in a separate HFS directory, not
     visible on the ISO-9660 volume. The HFS directory references
     the same data and resource fork files described above.

     In most cases, it is better to use the -hhffss  option  instead
     of  the  -aappppllee  option,  as  the latter imposes the limited
     ISO-9660 characters allowed in filenames. However, the Apple
     extensions  do  give the advantage that the files are packed
     on the disk more efficiently and it may be possible  to  fit
     more  files  on  a CD - important when the total size of the
     source files is approaching 650MB.

     Where possible, the HFS filename  that  is  stored  with  an
     Apple/Unix file is used for the HFS part of the CD. However,
     not all the Apple/Unix encodings store the HFS filename with
     the  finderinfo. In these cases, the Unix filename is used -
     with escaped special characters. Special characters  include
     '/' and characters with codes over 127.

     Aufs escapes these characters by using ":" followed  by  the
     character  code  as  two hex digits. Netatalk and EtherShare
     have a similar scheme, but uses "%" instead of a ":".

     If mkisofs can't find an HFS filename, then it uses the Unix
     name,  with any %xx or :xx characters (xx == two hex digits)
     converted to a single character code. If "xx"  are  not  hex
     digits  ([0-9a-fA-F]),  then  they are left alone - although

     any remaining ":" is converted to "%" as colon  is  the  HFS
     directory separator. Care must be taken, as an ordinary Unix
     file with %xx or :xx will also be converted. e.g.

     This:2fFile   converted to This/File

     This:File     converted to This%File

     This:t7File   converted to This%t7File

     Although HFS filenames appear to  support  upper  and  lower
     case  letters,  the filesystem is case insensitive. i.e. the
     filenames "aBc" and "AbC" are the same. If a file  is  found
     in  a  directory  with  the same HFS name, then _m_k_i_s_o_f_s will
     attempt, where possible, to make a unique name by adding '_'
     characters to one of the filenames.

     If an HFS filename exists for a file, then mkisofs  can  use
     this name as the starting point for the ISO-9660, Joliet and
     Rock Ridge filenames using the -mmaacc-nnaammee option. Normal Unix
     files  without  an  HFS name will still use their Unix name.
     e.g.

     If  a  _M_a_c_B_i_n_a_r_y  (or  _P_C  _E_x_c_h_a_n_g_e)  file  is   stored   as
     _s_o_m_e_i_m_a_g_e._g_i_f._b_i_n on the Unix filesystem, but contains a HFS
     file called _s_o_m_e_i_m_a_g_e._g_i_f, then this is the name that  would
     appear  on  the HFS part of the CD. However, as mkisofs uses
     the Unix name as the starting point  for  the  other  names,
     then   the   ISO-9660   name   generated  will  probably  be
     _S_O_M_E_I_M_A_G._B_I_N   and   the   Joliet/Rock   Ridge   would    be
     _s_o_m_e_i_m_a_g_e._g_i_f._b_i_n.   Although the actual data (in this case)
     is a GIF image. This option will use the HFS filename as the
     starting  point  and  the  ISO-9660  name  will  probably be
     _S_O_M_E_I_M_A_G._G_I_F   and   the   Joliet/Rock   Ridge   would    be
     _s_o_m_e_i_m_a_g_e._g_i_f.

     Using the -mmaacc-nnaammee option will not currently work with  the
     -TT  option  -  the  Unix  name will be used in the TRANS.TBL
     file, not the Macintosh name.

     The character set used to convert any HFS  file  name  to  a
     Joliet/Rock Ridge file name defaults to _c_p_1_0_0_0_0 (Mac Roman).
     The  character  set  used  can  be   specified   using   the
     -_i_n_p_u_t-_h_f_s-_c_h_a_r_s_e_t option. Other built in HFS character sets
     are:  cp10006  (MacGreek),  cp10007  (MacCyrillic),  cp10029
     (MacLatin2), cp10079 (MacIcelandandic) and cp10081 (MacTurk-
     ish).

     Note: the character codes used by HFS file names taken  from
     the various Apple/Unix formats will not be converted as they
     are assumed to be in the correct Apple character  set.  Only
     the  Joliet/Rock Ridge names derived from the HFS file names

     will be converted.

     The existing mkisofs code will filter out any illegal  char-
     acters for the ISO-9660 and Joliet filenames, but as mkisofs
     expects to be dealing directly with Unix  names,  it  leaves
     the  Rock  Ridge  names  as  is.   But as '/' is a legal HFS
     filename character, the -mmaacc-nnaammee option converts '/'  to  a
     '_' in Rock Ridge filenames.

     If the Apple extensions are used,  then  only  the  ISO-9660
     filenames  will  appear  on  the  Macintosh. However, as the
     Macintosh ISO-9660 drivers can use _L_e_v_e_l _2  filenames,  then
     you can use options like -aallllooww-mmuullttiiddoott without problems on
     a Macintosh - still take care over the  names,  for  example
     _t_h_i_s._f_i_l_e._n_a_m_e will be converted to _T_H_I_S._F_I_L_E i.e. only have
     one '.', also filename _a_b_c_d_e_f_g_h will be seen as _A_B_C_D_E_F_G_H but
     _a_b_c_d_e_f_g_h_i  will be seen as _A_B_C_D_E_F_G_H_I. i.e. with a '.' at the
     end  -  don't  know  if  this  is  a  Macintosh  problem  or
     mkisofs/mkhybrid  problem.  All  filenames  will be in upper
     case when viewed  on  a  Macintosh.  Of  course,  DOS/Win3.X
     machines will not be able to see Level 2 filenames...

     To give a HFS CD a custom icon,  make  sure  the  root  (top
     level)  folder  includes  a  standard  Macintosh volume icon
     file. To give a volume a custom icon on a Macintosh, an icon
     has  to  be  pasted over the volume's icon in the "Get Info"
     box of the volume. This creates  an  invisible  file  called
     'Icon\r'  ('\r'  is  the 'carriage return' character) in the
     root folder.

     A custom folder icon is very similar  -  an  invisible  file
     called 'Icon\r' exits in the folder itself.

     Probably the easiest  way  to  create  a  custom  icon  that
     mkisofs  can  use, is to format a blank HFS floppy disk on a
     Mac, paste an icon to its "Get Info"  box.  If  using  Linux
     with  the HFS module installed, mount the floppy using some-
     thing like:

                mount -t hfs /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy

     The floppy will be mounted as a CAP file system by  default.
     Then run mkisofs using something like:

                mkisofs --cap -o output source_dir /mnt/floppy

     If you are not using Linux, then you can use the hfsutils to
     copy  the icon file from the floppy. However, care has to be
     taken, as the icon file contains a control character. e.g.

                hmount /dev/fd0
                hdir -a
                hcopy -m Icon^V^M icon_dir/icon

     Where '^V^M' is control-V followed by  control-M.  Then  run
     mmkkiissooffss by using something like:

                mkisofs --macbin -o output source_dir icon_dir

     The procedure for creating/using custom folder icons is very
     similar  -  paste  an  icon  to  folder's "Get Info" box and
     transfer the resulting 'Icon\r' file to the relevant  direc-
     tory in the mkisofs source tree.

     You may want to hide the icon files from  the  ISO-9660  and
     Joliet trees.

     To give a custom icon to a Joliet CD,  follow  the  instruc-
     tions                        found                       at:

     It _m_a_y be possible to make  the  hybrid  CD  bootable  on  a
     Macintosh.

     A bootable HFS CD requires an Apple CD-ROM  (or  compatible)
     driver,  a  bootable HFS partition and the necessary System,
     Finder, etc. files.

     A driver can be obtained from any other  Macintosh  bootable
     CD-ROM using the _a_p_p_l_e__d_r_i_v_e_r utility. This file can then be
     used with the -bboooott-hhffss-ffiillee option.

     The HFS partition (i.e. the hybrid disk in  our  case)  must
     contain  a suitable System Folder, again from another CD-ROM
     or disk.

     For a partition to be bootable, it must have its _b_o_o_t  _b_l_o_c_k
     set.  The  boot block is in the first two blocks of a parti-
     tion. For a non-bootable partition the boot block is full of
     zeros.  Normally,  when a System file is copied to partition
     on a Macintosh disk, the boot block is filled with a  number
     of  required  settings - unfortunately I don't know the full
     spec for the boot block, so I'm guessing that the  following
     will work OK.

     Therefore, the utility _a_p_p_l_e__d_r_i_v_e_r also extracts  the  boot
     block  from  the  first  HFS partition it finds on the given
     CD-ROM and this is used for the  HFS  partition  created  by
     mmkkiissooffss.

     When the -bboooott-iinnffoo-ttaabbllee  option  is  given,  mmkkiissooffss  will
     modify the boot file specified by the -bb option by inserting
     a 56-byte "boot information table" at offset 8 in the  file.
     This  modification is done in the source filesystem, so make
     sure you use a copy if this file is  not  easily  recreated!
     This file contains pointers which may not be easily or reli-
     ably obtained at boot time.

     The format of this table is as follows; all integers are  in
     section 7.3.1 ("little endian") format.

       Offset    Name           Size      Meaning
        8        bi_pvd         4 bytes   LBA of primary volume descriptor

       24        bi_reserved    40 bytes  Reserved

     The 32-bit checksum is the sum of all the  32-bit  words  in
     the  boot file starting at byte offset 64.  All linear block
     addresses (LBAs) are given  in  CD  sectors  (normally  2048

     the source directories _c_d__d_i_r and _a_n_o_t_h_e_r__d_i_r.  Files in all
     the known Apple/Unix format are decoded and any other  files
     are given CREATOR and TYPE based on their magic number given
     in the file "magic":

     % mkisofs -o cd.iso -apple -magic magic -probe \
             cd_dir another_dir

     The following example puts different files on  the  CD  that
     all  have  the name README, but have different contents when
     seen as a ISO-9660/RockRidge, Joliet or HFS CD.

     Current directory contains:

     % ls -F
     README.hfs     README.joliet  README.unix    cd_dir/

     The following command puts the  contents  of  the  directory
     _c_d__d_i_r  on  the  CD  along with the three README files - but
     only one will be seen from each of the three filesystems:

     % mkisofs -o cd.iso -hfs -J -r -graft-points \
             -hide README.hfs -hide README.joliet \
             -hide-joliet README.hfs -hide-joliet README.unix \
             -hide-hfs README.joliet -hide-hfs README.unix \
             README=README.hfs README=README.joliet \
             README=README.unix cd_dir

     i.e. the file README.hfs will be seen as README on  the  HFS
     CD  and the other two README files will be hidden. Similarly
     for the Joliet and ISO-9660/RockRidge CD.

     There are probably all sorts  of  strange  results  possible
     with combinations of the hide options ...

     MMkkiissooffss may safely be  installed  suid  root.  This  may  be
     needed  to  allow  mmkkiissooffss to read the previous session when
     creating a multi session image.

     mmkkiissooffss is not based on the standard mk*fs tools  for  unix,
     because  we  must  generate  a  complete copy of an existing
     filesystem on a disk in the  ISO-9660 filesystem.  The  name
     mkisofs  is  probably a bit of a misnomer, since it not only
     creates the filesystem, but it also populates  it  as  well.

     However,  the  appropriate  tool  name  for a UNIX tool that
     creates populated filesystems - mmkkpprroottoo - is not well known.

     If mmkkiissooffss is creating a filesystem image  with  Rock  Ridge
     attributes  and  the  directory  nesting level of the source
     directory tree is too much for  ISO-9660,  mmkkiissooffss  will  do
     deep  directory  relocation.   This  results  in a directory
     called RRRR__MMOOVVEEDD in the root directory of the CD. You  cannot
     avoid  this  directory in the directory tree that is visible
     with ISO-9660 but it it automatically  hidden  in  the  RRoocckk
     RRiiddggee tree.

     The  sparc  boot  support  that  is  implemented  with   the
     -ssppaarrcc-bboooott options completely follows the official Sparc CD
     boot requirements from the Boot prom in Sun  Sparc  systems.
     Some Linux distributions for Sparc systems use a boot loader
     called SSIILLOO that unfortunately is not Sparc CD boot  compli-
     ant.  It is annoyingly to see that the Authors of SILO don't
     fix SILO but instead provide a completely  unneeded  "patch"
     to  mkisofs  that  incorporates far more source than the fix
     for SILO would need.

BBUUGGSS
     +o    Does not properly read relocated directories in  multi-
          session mode when adding data.

          Any relocated deep directory is lost if the new session
          does not include the deep directory.

          Repeat by: create first  session  with  deep  directory
          relocation  then add new session with a single dir that
          differs from the old deep path.

     +o    Does not re-use RR_MOVED when doing multi-session  from
          TRANS.TBL

     There may be some other ones.  Please, report  them  to  the
     author.


HHFFSS PPRROOBBLLEEMMSS//LLIIMMIITTAATTIIOONNSS
     I have had to make several assumptions on how I  expect  the
     modified  libhfs  routines  to  work,  however  there may be
     situations that either I haven't thought of, or come  across
     when  these  assumptions  fail.  Therefore I can't guarantee
     that mkisofs will work as expected (although I haven't had a
     major problem yet). Most of the HFS features work fine, how-
     ever, some are not fully tested. These are marked  as  _A_l_p_h_a
     above.

     Although HFS filenames appear to  support  upper  and  lower
     case  letters,  the filesystem is case insensitive. i.e. the



Version 3.0          Last change: 2010/04/25                   50






Maintenance Procedures                                 MKISOFS(8)



     filenames "aBc" and "AbC" are the same. If a file  is  found
     in  a  directory  with  the same HFS name, then _m_k_i_s_o_f_s will
     attempt, where possible, to make a unique name by adding '_'
     characters to one of the filenames.

     HFS file/directory names that share the first 31  characters
     have  _N' (N == decimal number) substituted for the last few
     characters to generate unique names.

     Care must be  taken  when  "grafting"  Apple/Unix  files  or
     directories  (see above for the method and syntax involved).
     It is not possible to use  a  new  name  for  an  Apple/Unix
     encoded  file/directory.  e.g.  If a Apple/Unix encoded file
     called "oldname" is to added to the CD, then you can not use
     the command line:

          mkisofs    -o     output.raw     -hfs     -graft-points
          newname=oldname cd_dir

     mkisofs will be unable to decode "oldname". However, you can
     graft Apple/Unix encoded files or directories as long as you
     do not attempt to give them new names as above.

     When creating an HFS volume with the  multisession  options,
     -MM and -CC, only files in the last session will be in the HFS
     volume. i.e. mkisofs can not _a_d_d existing files from  previ-
     ous sessions to the HFS volume.

     However, if each session is created with the  -ppaarrtt  option,
     then  each  session  will  appear  as  separate volumes when
     mounted on a Mac. In this case, it is worth using the -VV  or
     -hhffss-vvoolliidd option to give each session a unique volume name,
     otherwise each "volume" will appear on the Desktop with  the
     same name.

     Symbolic links (as with all other non-regular files) are not
     added to the HFS directory.

     Hybrid volumes may be larger than pure ISO-9660 volumes con-
     taining  the  same  data.  In  some  cases  (e.g.  DVD sized
     volumes) the hybrid volume may be significantly  larger.  As
     an HFS volume gets bigger, so does the allocation block size
     (the smallest amount of space a file  can  occupy).   For  a
     650Mb  CD,  the allocation block is 10Kb, for a 4.7Gb DVD it
     will be about 70Kb.

     The maximum number of files in an HFS volume is about  65500
     - although the real limit will be somewhat less than this.

     The resulting hybrid  volume  can  be  accessed  on  a  Unix
     machine  by using the hfsutils routines. However, no changes
     can be made to the volume as it is set as lloocckkeedd.. The option

     -hhffss-uunnlloocckk  will  create an output image that is unlocked -
     however no changes should be made to  the  contents  of  the
     volume  (unless  you really know what you are doing) as it's
     not a "real" HFS volume.

     Using the -mmaacc-nnaammee option will not currently work with  the
     -TT  option  -  the  Unix  name will be used in the TRANS.TBL
     file, not the Macintosh name.

     Although mmkkiissooffss does not alter the contents of a file, if a
     binary  file  has  its  TYPE  set  as 'TEXT', it _m_a_y be read
     incorrectly on a Macintosh. Therefore a  better  choice  for
     the default TYPE may be '????'

     The -mmaacc-bboooott-ffiillee option may not work at all...

     May not work with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher  files  (avail-
     able  with  MacOS  8.1).   DOS  media containing PC Exchange
     files should be mounted as type mmssddooss (not vvffaatt) when  using
     Linux.

     The SFM format is only partially supported - see HHFFSS  MMAACCIINN--
     TTOOSSHH FFIILLEE FFOORRMMAATTSS section above.

     It  is  not  possible  to  use  the   the   -ssppaarrcc-bboooott   or

     mmkkiissooffss should be able to create HFS hybrid images over 4Gb,
