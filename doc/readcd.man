     Most users do not need to care about device naming  at  all.
     If no ddeevv== option was specified, rreeaaddccdd implements aauuttoo ttaarr--
     ggeett support and automagically finds the drive in  case  that
     exactly  one  CD-ROM  type drive is available in the system.
     In case that more than one CD-ROM type drive exists  on  the
     system,  a  list  of  possible device name parameters may be
     retrieved with rreeaaddccdd -ssccaannbbuuss or from  the  target  example
     from  the output of rreeaaddccdd ddeevv==hheellpp, then the ddeevv== parameter
     may be set based on the device listing.

     The _d_e_v_i_c_e parameter to  the  ddeevv==  option  explained  below
     refers  to _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n of the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder.
     If a file /etc/default/cdrecord exists, the parameter to the
     ddeevv== option may also be a drive name label in said file (see
     FILES section).


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     If no options except the _d_e_v= option  have  been  specified,
     rreeaaddccdd  goes  into interactive mode.  Select a primary func-
     tion and then follow the instructions.

          error correction at sub-channel level. Even in the main
          data channel, there is less error correction than  with
          other  read  modes.  This results in a slightly quality
          degradation. Avoid copying audio CDs in cclloonnee mode  for
          this reason.

     -cc22ssccaann
          Scans the whole  CD  or  the  range  specified  by  the
          sseeccttoorrss==_r_a_n_g_e  for C2 errors. C2 errors are errors that
          are uncorrectable after the second stage of the 24/28 +
          28/32  Reed  Solomon  correction  system at audio level
          (2352 bytes sector size). If an audio CD has C2 errors,
          interpolation  is  needed to hide the errors. If a data
          CD has C2  errors,  these  errors  are  in  most  cases
          corrected by the ECC/EDC code that makes 2352 bytes out
          of 2048 data bytes. The ECC/EDC code should be able  to
          correct about 100 C2 error bytes per sector.

          If you find C2 errors you may want to reduce the  speed
          using the ssppeeeedd== option as C2 errors may be a result of
          dynamic unbalance on the medium.

     -ccxxssccaann
          Scans the whole  CD  or  the  range  specified  by  the
          sseeccttoorrss==_r_a_n_g_e  for  C1/C2/CU  errors.   In  non-verbose
          mode, only a summary is printed.  With -vv, a  line  for
          each  non  error  free  second is printed.  with -vvvv, a
          line for each second is printed.  This scan method only
          works for a few drives.

     -eeddcc-ccoorrrr
          In  this  mode,  rreeaaddccdd  reads  CD  data   sectors   in
          uncorrected  audio  mode  and then tries to correct the
          data using  the  ECC/EDC  decoder  library  from  Heiko
          Eissfeldt.  As this library implements looping over two
          layers of error  correction,  rreeaaddccdd  may  be  able  to
          correct  more  data  than  the  firmware  of the CD-ROM
          drive.

          This option is currently experimental and only applica-
          ble  with  CD  media  and currently only supports plain
          2048 Byte CD-ROM sectors.

     ff==_f_i_l_e
          Specify the filename where the output should be written
          or  the  input  should  be  taken  from.  Using  '-' as
          filename will cause rreeaaddccdd to use ssttddoouutt resp. ssttddiinn.

     -ffaaccttoorr
          Output the speed  values  for  mmeesshhppooiinnttss==#  as  factor
          based on _s_i_n_g_l_e _s_p_e_e_d of the current medium.  This only
          works if rreeaaddccdd is able to determine the current medium

     -ffuullllttoocc
          Retrieve a full TOC from the current disk and print  it
          in hex.

     mmeesshhppooiinnttss==#
          Print read-speed at # locations.  The purpose  of  this
          option  is  to create a list of read speed values suit-
          able for e.g.  ggnnuupplloott.  The speed  values  are  calcu-
          lated  assuming  that  1000  bytes  are one kilobyte as
          documented in  the  SCSI  standard.   The  output  data
          created for this purpose is written to _s_t_d_o_u_t.

     -nnooccoorrrr
          Switch the drive into a  mode  where  it  ignores  read
          errors  in data sectors that are a result of uncorrect-
          able ECC/EDC errors before  reading.   If  rreeaaddccdd  com-
          pletes,  the  error  recovery  mode  of  the  drive  is
          switched back to the remembered old mode.

     -nnooeerrrroorr
          Do not abort if the high level error checking in rreeaaddccdd
          found an uncorrectable error in the data stream.

     -nnoottrruunncc
          Do not truncate the output file when opening it.

     -oovveerrhheeaadd
          Meter the SCSI command overhead time.  This is done  by
          executing  several commands 1000 times and printing the
          total time used. If you divide the displayed  times  by
          1000,  you  get  the average overhead time for a single
          command.

     -ppii88ssccaann
          Scans the whole DVD  or  the  range  specified  by  the
          sseeccttoorrss==_r_a_n_g_e  for ppiissuumm88 errors.  In non-verbose mode,
          only a summary is printed.  With -vv, a  line  for  each
          non  error  free  block  of 8 * 32 kB is printed.  with
          -vvvv, a line for each block of 8 *  32  kB  is  printed.
          This scan method only works for a few drives.

     -ppiiffssccaann
          Scans the whole DVD  or  the  range  specified  by  the
          sseeccttoorrss==_r_a_n_g_e  for  ppiiff  errors.   In non-verbose mode,

          This option modified the behavior for -ccxxssccaann, -ppii88ssccaann
          and -ppiiffssccaann.  The output is better suited for gnuplot.

     rreettrriieess==#
          Set the retry count for high level retries in rreeaaddccdd to
          #.   The  default is to do 128 retries which may be too
          much if you like to read a CD with many unreadable sec-
          tors.

     sseeccttoorrss==_r_a_n_g_e
          Specify a sector range that should be read.  The  range
          is  specified  by  the  starting sector number, a minus
          sign and the ending sector number.  The end  sector  is
          not  included in the list, so sseeccttoorrss==0-0 will not read
          anything and may be used to  check  for  a  CD  in  the
          drive.

     ssppeeeedd==#
          Set the speed factor of the read or write process to #.
          #  is  an integer, representing a multiple of the audio
          speed.  This is about 150 KB/s for CD-ROM and about 172
          KB/s  for  CD-Audio.   If  no  _s_p_e_e_d option is present,
          rreeaaddccdd will use  maximum  speed.   Only  MMC  compliant
          drives will benefit from this option.  The speed of non
          MMC drives is not changed.

          Using a lower speed may increase the readability  of  a
          CD or DVD.

     -ww   Switch to write mode.   Writing  is  only  possible  to
          DVD-RAM  media.  For other media, use ccddrreeccoorrdd instead.
          Note that  ccddrreeccoorrdd  also  supports  to  write  DVD-RAM
          media.

          If this option is not present, rreeaaddccdd  reads  from  the
          specified device.

     ddeevv==_t_a_r_g_e_t
          Set the SCSI target for the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder, see
          notes  above.  A typical target device specification is
          ddeevv==_1,_6,_0 .  If a filename must  be  provided  together
          with  the  numerical target specification, the filename
          is implementation specific.  The  correct  filename  in
          this  case  can be found in the system specific manuals
          of the target operating system.  On  a  _F_r_e_e_B_S_D  system
          without _C_A_M support, you need to use the control device
          (e.g.  /_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l).  A correct device  specification
          in this case may be ddeevv==/_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l:@ .

          munication on _S_u_n_O_S  is  done  with  the  SCSI  general
          driver ssccgg.. Other operating systems are using a library
          simulation of this driver.  Possible syntax  is:   ddeevv==

          case, the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder has to be connected to
          the  default  SCSI bus of the machine.  _S_c_s_i_b_u_s, _t_a_r_g_e_t
          and _l_u_n are integer numbers. Some operating systems  or
          SCSI transport implementations may require to specify a
          filename in addition.  In this case the correct  syntax
          for  the device is:  ddeevv== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t, or

          node that has been specified on such a system refers to
          exactly one SCSI device, a shorthand in the  form  ddeevv==

          To access remote SCSI devices, you need to prepend  the
          SCSI  device  name  by  a  remote device indicator. The
          remote device indicator is either RREEMMOOTTEE::_u_s_e_r@_h_o_s_t:  or
          RREEMMOOTTEE::_h_o_s_t:   A  valid remote SCSI device name may be:
          RREEMMOOTTEE::_u_s_e_r@_h_o_s_t:  to allow remote SCSI bus scanning or
          RREEMMOOTTEE::_u_s_e_r@_h_o_s_t:_1,_0,_0  to  access  the  SCSI device at

          order  to  allow  remote access to a specific _h_o_s_t, the

          CCddrreeccoorrdd is completely based on SSCCSSII commands but  this
          is  no  problem  as all CD/DVD/BluRay writers ever made
          use SSCCSSII commands for  the  communication.  Even  AATTAAPPII
          drives are just SSCCSSII drives that inherently use the _A_T_A
          _p_a_c_k_e_t _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e as SSCCSSII command transport layer  build
          into  the IDE (ATA) transport.  You may need to specify
          an alternate transport layer on the  command   line  if
          your  OS  does  not implement a fully integrated kernel
          driver subsystem that allows to access any drive  using
          SSCCSSII commands via a single unique user interface.

          To access SCSI devices via alternate transport  layers,
          you need to prepend the SCSI device name by a transport
          layer indicator.  The transport layer indicator may  be
          something like UUSSCCSSII:: or AATTAAPPII::.  To get a list of sup-

          present,  or  if it only contains a transport specifyer

          well as with sector  sizes  and  sector  types.   Using

          commands.

     ttiimmeeoouutt==#
          Set  the  default  SCSI  command  timeout  value  to  #
          seconds.   The  default  SCSI  command  timeout  is the
          minimum timeout used for sending SCSI commands.   If  a
          SCSI  command  fails  due  to a timeout, you may try to
          raise  the  default  SCSI  command  timeout  above  the
          timeout  value  of  the failed command.  If the command
          runs correctly with a raised  command  timeout,  please
          report  the  better timeout value and the corresponding
          command to the author of the program.   If  no  _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
          option  is  present, a default timeout of 40 seconds is
          used.

     ttss==# Set the maximum transfer size for a single SCSI command
          to #.  The syntax for the ttss== option is the same as for
          cdrecord fs=# or sdd bs=#.

          If no ttss== option has been specified, rreeaaddccdd defaults to
          a  transfer size of 256 kB. If libscg gets lower values
          from the operating system, the value is reduced to  the
          maximum value that is possible with the current operat-
          ing system.  Sometimes, it may help to  further  reduce
          the  transfer  size  or to enhance it, but note that it
          may take a long time to find a better value by  experi-
          menting with the ttss== option.

     -VV   Increment the verbose level with respect of  SCSI  com-
          mand  transport  by  one.  This helps to debug problems
          during the process, that occur in the  CD-Recorder.  If
          you  get incomprehensible error messages you should use
          this flag to get more detailed output.  -VVVV  will  show
          data buffer content in addition.  Using -VV or -VVVV slows
          down the process.

     You should not  connect  old  drives  that  do  not  support
     disconnect/reconnect  to  either  the  SCSI bus that is con-
     nected to the CD-Recorder or the source disk.

     When using rreeaaddccdd with the LLiinnuuxx SSCCSSII  ggeenneerriicc  ddrriivveerr..  You
     should  note that rreeaaddccdd uses a layer, that tries to emulate
     the functionality of the scg driver on top of the drives  of
     the local operating system.  Unfortunately, the sg driver on
     LLiinnuuxx has several flaws:

     +o    It cannot see if a SCSI command could not  be  sent  at
          all.

     +o    It cannot get the SCSI status  byte.  RReeaaddccdd  for  that
          reason  cannot  report  failing  SCSI  commands in some
          situations.

     +o    It cannot get real DMA count of transfer. RReeaaddccdd cannot
          tell you if there is an DMA residual count.

     +o    It cannot get number of bytes valid in auto sense data.
          RReeaaddccdd  cannot  tell  you  if device transfers no sense
          data at all.

     +o    It  fetches  to  few  data  in   auto   request   sense
          (CCS/SCSI-2/SCSI-3 needs >= 18).

     A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:

          readcd: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no error
          CDB:  00 20 00 00 00 00
          status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
          Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 25 00 00 00 00 00
          Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0
          Sense Code: 0x25 Qual 0x00 (logical unit not supported) Fru 0x0
          Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid)
          cmd finished after 0.002s timeout 40s

     The first line gives information about the transport of  the
     command.   The  text  after  the first colon gives the error
     text for the system call from the view  of  the  kernel.  It
     usually  is:   II//OO  eerrrroorr  unless other problems happen. The
     next words contain a short description for the SCSI  command
     that fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were any
     problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
     ffaattaall  eerrrroorr means that it was not possible to transport the
     command (i.e.  no  device  present  at  the  requested  SCSI
     address).

     The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block for
     the failed command.

     The third line gives information on  the  SCSI  status  code
     returned  by  the  command,  if the transport of the command
     succeeds. This is error information from the SCSI device.

     The fourth line is a hex dump  of  the  auto  request  sense
     information for the command.

     The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if avail-
     able,  followed  by the segment number that is only valid if
     the command was a _c_o_p_y command. If the error message is  not
     directly  related  to the current command, the text _d_e_f_e_r_r_e_d
     _e_r_r_o_r is appended.

     The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and  the
     sense  qualifier if available.  If the type of the device is
     known, the sense data is decoded from tables in _s_c_s_i_e_r_r_s._c .
     The text is followed by the error value for a field replace-
     able unit.

     The seventh line prints the block number that is related  to
     the  failed  command  and  text for several error flags. The
     block number may not be valid.

     The eight line reports the timeout set up for  this  command
     and the time that the command really needed to complete.
