     BBttccffllaasshh is used to read  update  the  Firmware  for  a  BTC
     DRW1008 DVD+/-RW recorder.

     Be very careful when writing firmware as this  program  does
     not check for the correctness of the target device.

  DDeevviiccee nnaammiinngg
     For a list of possible device name parameters call  bbttccffllaasshh
     -ssccaannbbuuss  or  bbttccffllaasshh  ddeevv==hheellpp and then use the right ddeevv==
     parameter based on the device listing.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     -hheellpp
          Prints a short summary of the pp options and exists.

     -vveerrssiioonn
          Print version information and exit.

     ddeevv==_t_a_r_g_e_t
          Set the SCSI target for the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder, see
          notes  above.  A typical target device specification is
          ddeevv==_1,_6,_0 .  If a filename must  be  provided  together
          with  the  numerical target specification, the filename
          is implementation specific.  The  correct  filename  in
          this  case  can be found in the system specific manuals
          of the target operating system.  On  a  _F_r_e_e_B_S_D  system
          without _C_A_M support, you need to use the control device
          (e.g.  /_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l).  A correct device  specification
          in this case may be ddeevv==/_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l:@ .

          The  _t_a_r_g_e_t  _d_e_v_i_c_e  to  the  ddeevv==  option  refers   to
          _s_c_s_i_b_u_s/_t_a_r_g_e_t/_l_u_n  of the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder. Com-
          munication on _S_u_n_O_S  is  done  with  the  SCSI  general
          driver ssccgg.. Other operating systems are using a library
          simulation of this driver.  Possible syntax  is:   ddeevv==
          _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n  or  ddeevv== _t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.  In the latter
          case, the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder has to be connected to
          the  default  SCSI bus of the machine.  _S_c_s_i_b_u_s, _t_a_r_g_e_t
          and _l_u_n are integer numbers. Some operating systems  or
          SCSI transport implementations may require to specify a
          filename in addition.  In this case the correct  syntax
          for  the device is:  ddeevv== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t, or

          node that has been specified on such a system refers to
          exactly one SCSI device, a shorthand in the  form  ddeevv==

          To access remote SCSI devices, you need to prepend  the
          SCSI  device  name  by  a  remote device indicator. The
          remote device indicator is either RREEMMOOTTEE::_u_s_e_r@_h_o_s_t:  or
          RREEMMOOTTEE::_h_o_s_t:   A  valid remote SCSI device name may be:
          RREEMMOOTTEE::_u_s_e_r@_h_o_s_t:  to allow remote SCSI bus scanning or
          RREEMMOOTTEE::_u_s_e_r@_h_o_s_t:_1,_0,_0  to  access  the  SCSI device at
          _h_o_s_t connected to SCSI bus # 1,target  0,  lun  0.   In
          order  to  allow  remote access to a specific _h_o_s_t, the
          rrssccssii(1) program needs to be present and configured  on
          the _h_o_s_t.

          AATTAAPPII drives are just SSCCSSII drives that  inherently  use
          the  _A_T_A  _p_a_c_k_e_t  _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e  as  SSCCSSII command transport
          layer build into the IDE (ATA) transport.  You may need
          to  specify an alternate transport layer on the command
          line if your OS does not implement a  fully  integrated
          kernel driver subsystem that allows to access any drive
          using SSCCSSII commands via a single unique user interface.

          To access SCSI devices via alternate transport  layers,
          you need to prepend the SCSI device name by a transport
          layer indicator.  The transport layer indicator may  be
          something like UUSSCCSSII:: or AATTAAPPII::.  To get a list of sup-
          ported transport layers for  your  platform,  use  ddeevv==

          To make bbttccffllaasshh portable to all  UNIX  platforms,  the
          syntax  ddeevv== _d_e_v_i_c_e_n_a_m_e:_s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t, is preferred as
          it hides OS specific knowledge about device names  from
          the  user.  A specific OS may not necessarily support a
          way to specify a real device file name  nor  a  way  to
          specify _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n.

          _S_c_s_i_b_u_s 0 is the default SCSI bus on the machine. Watch
          the  boot  messages  for  more information or look into
          //vvaarr//aaddmm//mmeessssaaggeess for more information about  the  SCSI
          configuration of your machine.  If you have problems to
          figure out what values for _s_c_s_i_b_u_s,_t_a_r_g_e_t,_l_u_n should be

          present,  or  if it only contains a transport specifyer
          but no address notation, bbttccffllaasshh  tries  to  scan  the
          SCSI  address  space for CD-ROM drives.  If exactly one
          is found, this is used by default.

     ttiimmeeoouutt==#
          Set  the  default  SCSI  command  timeout  value  to  #
          seconds.   The  default  SCSI  command  timeout  is the
          minimum timeout used for sending SCSI commands.   If  a
          SCSI  command  fails  due  to a timeout, you may try to
          raise  the  default  SCSI  command  timeout  above  the
          timeout  value  of  the failed command.  If the command
          runs correctly with a raised  command  timeout,  please
          report  the  better timeout value and the corresponding
          command to the author of the program.   If  no  _t_i_m_e_o_u_t

          used.

          Set the misc debug value to # (with debug=#) or  incre-
          ment  the  misc  debug  level  by one (with -d). If you
          specify -_d_d, this equals to ddeebbuugg==_2.  This may help  to
          find  problems  while  opening a driver for libscg.  as

          this flag to get more detailed output.  -VVVV  will  show

          Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and print  the
          inquiry  strings.  This option may be used to find SCSI
          address of  the  devices  on  a  system.   The  numbers
          printed out as labels are computed by: bbuuss ** 110000 ++ ttaarr--

     ttss==# Set the maximum transfer size for a single SCSI command
          to #.  The syntax for the ttss== option is the same as for

          If no ttss== option has been specified, bbttccffllaasshh  defaults
          to  a  transfer  size  of  256 kB. If libscg gets lower
          values from the operating system, the value is  reduced
          to  the maximum value that is possible with the current
          operating system.  Sometimes, it may  help  to  further
          reduce  the  transfer  size  or to enhance it, but note
          that it may take a long time to find a better value  by
          experimenting with the ttss== option.

          Note that this forces ccddrreeccoorrdd to create a pipe to  the

          access the network socket to the remote  server.   This
          makes  it  impossible  to set up performance parameters

     A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:

          btcflash: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no error
          CDB:  00 20 00 00 00 00

          Sense Code: 0x25 Qual 0x00 (logical unit not supported) Fru 0x0
          Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid)
          cmd finished after 0.002s timeout 40s

     The first line gives information about the transport of  the
     command.   The  text  after  the first colon gives the error
     text for the system call from the view  of  the  kernel.  It
     usually  is:   II//OO  eerrrroorr  unless other problems happen. The
     next words contain a short description for the SCSI  command
     that fails. The rest of the line tells you if there were any
     problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
     ffaattaall  eerrrroorr means that it was not possible to transport the
     command (i.e.  no  device  present  at  the  requested  SCSI
     address).

     The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block for
     the failed command.

     The third line gives information on  the  SCSI  status  code
     returned  by  the  command,  if the transport of the command
     succeeds. This is error information from the SCSI device.

     The fourth line is a hex dump  of  the  auto  request  sense
     information for the command.

     The fifth line is the error text for the sense key if avail-
     able,  followed  by the segment number that is only valid if
     the command was a _c_o_p_y command. If the error message is  not
     directly  related  to the current command, the text _d_e_f_e_r_r_e_d
     _e_r_r_o_r is appended.

     The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and  the
     sense  qualifier if available.  If the type of the device is
     known, the sense data is decoded from tables in _s_c_s_i_e_r_r_s._c .
     The text is followed by the error value for a field replace-
     able unit.

     The seventh line prints the block number that is related  to
     the  failed  command  and  text for several error flags. The
     block number may not be valid.
