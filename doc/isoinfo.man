     ddeevvdduummpp is a crude utility to interactively display the con-
     tents of device or filesystem images.  The initial screen is
     a display of the first 256 bytes of the first 2048 byte sec-
     tor.  The commands are the same as with iissoodduummpp.

     iissoodduummpp is a crude utility to interactively display the con-
     tents  of  iso9660  images  in  order  to  verify  directory
     integrity.  The initial screen is a  display  of  the  first
     part  of  the  root  directory, and the prompt shows you the
     extent number and offset in the extent.

          You can use the 'a' and 'b' commands to move  backwards
          and  forwards  within the image. The 'g' command allows
          you to goto an arbitrary extent, and  the  'f'  command
          specifies  a  search string to be used. The '+' command
          searches forward for the next instance  of  the  search
          string, and the 'q' command exits ddeevvdduummpp or iissoodduummpp.

     iissooiinnffoo is a utility to perform directory like  listings  of
     iso9660 images.

     iissoovvffyy is a utility to verify the integrity  of  an  iso9660
     image.  Most  of  the  tests in iissoovvffyy were added after bugs
     were discovered in early versions of mmkkiissooffss.. It  isn't  all
     that  clear  how useful this is anymore, but it doesn't hurt
     to have this around.


OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The options common to all  programs  are  -hheellpp,-hh,-vveerrssiioonn,
     ii=_n_a_m_e,ddeevv=_n_a_m_e.  The iissooiinnffoo program has additional command
     line options. The options are:

     -hheellpp

     -hh   print a summary of all options.

     -dd   Print information from the  primary  volume  descriptor
          (PVD)  of  the iso9660 image. This includes information
          about Rock Ridge, Joliet extensions and  Eltorito  boot
          information if present.

     -ff   generate output as if a 'find  .  -print'  command  had
          been  run  on the iso9660 image. You should not use the
          --ll image with the --ff option.

     -ii iissoo__iimmaaggee
          Specifies the path of the iso9660 image that we wish to
          examine.   The  options  -ii  and  ddeevv==_t_a_r_g_e_t are mutual
          exclusive.

     ddeevv==_t_a_r_g_e_t
          Sets the SCSI target for the drive, see notes above.  A
          typical   device  specification  is  ddeevv==_6,_0  .   If  a
          filename must be provided together with  the  numerical
          target  specification,  the  filename is implementation
          specific.  The correct filename in  this  case  can  be
          found  in  the  system  specific  manuals of the target
          operating system.  On a _F_r_e_e_B_S_D system without _C_A_M sup-
          port,   you  need  to  use  the  control  device  (e.g.
          /_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l).  A correct device specification in this
          case may be ddeevv==/_d_e_v/_r_c_d_0._c_t_l:@ .

          On Linux, drives connected to a parallel  port  adapter
          are  mapped  to  a virtual SCSI bus. Different adapters
          are mapped to different targets on  this  virtual  SCSI
          bus.

          If no _d_e_v option is present, the program  will  try  to
          get the device from the CCDDRR__DDEEVVIICCEE environment.

          If the argument to the ddeevv== option does not contain the
          characters  ',',  '/', '@' or ':', it is interpreted as
          an  label  name  that  may  be  found   in   the   file
          /etc/default/cdrecord (see FILES section).

          The options -ii and ddeevv==_t_a_r_g_e_t are mutual exclusive.

     -ddeebbuugg
          Print additional debug information. This  enables  e.g.
          printing  of  all  directory entries if a file has more
          than one directory entry and printing of more  informa-
          tion from the primary volume descriptor.

          In debug mode, Rock Ridge information is parsed with -RR
          even if it is not standard compliant.

     -ll   generate output as if a 'ls -lR' command had  been  run
          on  the iso9660 image.  You should not use the --ff image

     -NN sseeccttoorr
          Quick hack to help examine single  session  disc  files
          that  are  to  be  written to a multi-session disc. The
          sector number specified is the sector number  at  which
          the  iso9660  image  should be written when send to the
          cd-writer. Not used for the first session on the disc.

     -pp   Print path table information.

     -RR   Extract information  from  Rock  Ridge  extensions  (if
          present) for permissions, file names and ownerships.

     -JJ   Extract information from Joliet extensions (if present)
          for file names.

     -jj cchhaarrsseett
          Convert Joliet file names (if present) to the  supplied
          charset. See mmkkiissooffss(8) for details.

     -TT sseeccttoorr
          Quick hack to help examine  multi-session  images  that
          have  already  been burned to a multi-session disc. The
          sector number specified is the sector  number  for  the
          start of the session we wish to display.

     -xx ppaatthhnnaammee
          Extract specified file to stdout.

     The user interface really sucks.

     These utilities are really quick hacks, which are very  use-
     ful  for  debugging  problems  in  mkisofs  or in an iso9660
     filesystem. In the long run, it would be nice to have a dae-
     mon that would NFS export a iso9660 image.

     The isoinfo program is probably the program that is  of  the
     most use to the general user.

AAVVAAIILLAABBIILLIITTYY
     These utilities come with the ccddrrttoooollss package, and the pri-
     mary  ftp  site  is ftp.berlios.de in /pub/cdrecord and many
     other mirror sites. Despite the name, the  software  is  not
     beta.


EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     CCDDRR__DDEEVVIICCEE
          This may either hold a device identifier that is  suit-
          able  to the open call of the SCSI transport library or
          a label in the file /etc/default/cdrecord.

     RRSSHH  If the RRSSHH environment is present, the  remote  connec-
          tion will not be created via rrccmmdd(3) but by calling the
          program pointed to by RRSSHH.  Use  e.g.  RRSSHH==/usr/bin/ssh
          to create a secure shell connection.

          Note that this forces the program to create a  pipe  to
          the   rrsshh((11))  program  and  disallows  the  program  to
          directly  access  the  network  socket  to  the  remote
          server.  This makes it impossible to set up performance
          parameters and slows down the connection compared to  a
          rroooott initiated rrccmmdd((33)) connection.

     RRSSCCSSII
          If the RRSSCCSSII environment is present,  the  remote  SCSI
          server  will  not be the program //oopptt//sscchhiillyy//ssbbiinn//rrssccssii
          but the program pointed to by  RRSSCCSSII.   Note  that  the
          remote  SCSI server program name will be ignored if you
          log in using an account that has been  created  with  a
          remote SCSI server program as login shell.

     /etc/default/cdrecord
          Default values can be set for the following options  in
          /etc/default/cdrecord.

          CDR_DEVICE
               This may either hold a device identifier  that  is
               suitable  to  the  open call of the SCSI transport
               library    or    a    label    in     the     file
               /etc/default/cdrecord  that  allows  to identify a
               specific drive on the system.

          Any other label
               is an identifier for a specific drive on the  sys-
               tem.  Such an identifier may not contain the char-
               acters ',', '/', '@' or ':'.

               Each line that follows  a  label  contains  a  TAB

               separated  list  of  items.  Currently, four items
               are recognized: the SCSI  ID  of  the  drive,  the
               default  speed that should be used for this drive,
               the default FIFO size that should be used for this
               drive  and  drive specific options. The values for
               _s_p_e_e_d and _f_i_f_o_s_i_z_e may be set to -1  to  tell  the
               program to use the global defaults.  The value for
               driveropts may be set to "" if no  driveropts  are
               used.  A typical line may look this way:

               teac1= 0,5,0   4    8m   ""

               yamaha= 1,6,0  -1   -1   burnfree

               This tells the program that a drive named _t_e_a_c_1 is
               at  scsibus  0, target 5, lun 0 and should be used
               with speed 4 and a FIFO size of 8  MB.   A  second
               drive  may  be found at scsibus 1, target 6, lun 0
               and uses the default speed and  the  default  FIFO
               size.
