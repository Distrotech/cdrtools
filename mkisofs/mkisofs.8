.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkisofs
is effectively a pre-mastering program to generate an ISO-9660/JOLIET/HFS/UDF hybrid
filesystem.
.PP
ISO-9660/JOLIET/UDF filesystems are limited to a maximum size of 8\ TB.
The maximum size of a single file is 8\ TB (single files in UDF are currently 
limited to aprox. 200\ GB).
If yo like to have files
larger than 2 \GB, you need to specify 
.B \-iso\-level 3
or above.
If a HFS hybrid is created, the maximum
file size for files in the HFS hybrid is 2\ GB in any case.
.SS "Hybrid filesystem support
.PP
.B mkisofs
is capable of generating the 
.B "System Use Sharing Protocol records (SUSP)
specified
by the 
.B "Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol.
This is used to further describe the
files in the ISO-9660 filesystem to a unix host, and provides information such
as longer filenames, uid/gid, posix permissions, symbolic links, hard links,
block and character devices.
.PP
If Joliet, HFS or UDF hybrid command line options are specified, 
.B mkisofs
will create additional separate filesystem meta data for Joliet, HFS or UDF.
The file content in this case refers to the same data blocks on the media.
It
will generate a pure ISO-9660 filesystem unless the Joliet, HFS or UDF hybrid command
line options are given.
.PP
.B mkisofs
can generate a 
.I true
(or
.IR shared )
HFS hybrid filesystem. The same files are seen as HFS files when
accessed from a Macintosh and as ISO-9660 files when accessed from other 
machines. HFS stands for
.I Hierarchical File System
and is the native file system used on Macintosh computers up to Mac\ OS\ 9.
.PP
As an alternative,
.B mkisofs
can generate the
.I "Apple Extensions to ISO-9660
or
.I UDF
for each file. These extensions provide each file with CREATOR, TYPE and
certain Finder Flags when accessed from a Macintosh. See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below.
.SS "Functional description
.PP
.B mkisofs
takes a snapshot of a given directory tree, and generates a
binary image which will correspond to an ISO-9660 or Joliet/HFS/UDF filesystem when
written to a block device.
.PP
Each file written to the ISO-9660 filesystem must have a filename in the 8.3
format (8 characters, period, 3 characters, all upper case), even if Rock Ridge
attributes are in use.  This filename is used on systems that are not able to make use of
the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS), and each filename in each directory
must be different from the other filenames in the same directory.
.B mkisofs
generally tries to form correct names by forcing the unix filename to upper
case and truncating as required, but often times this yields unsatisfactory
results when there are cases where the
truncated names are not all unique.
.B mkisofs
assigns weightings to each filename, and if two names that are otherwise the
same are found the name with the lower priority is renamed to have a 3 digit
number as an extension (where the number is guaranteed to be unique).  An
example of this would be the files foo.bar and
foo.bar.~1~ - the file foo.bar.~1~ would be written as FOO000.BAR;1 and the file
foo.bar would be written as FOO.BAR;1
.PP
When used with various HFS or UDF options,
.B mkisofs
will attempt to recognise files stored in a number of Apple/Unix file formats
and will copy the data and resource forks as well as any
relevant finder information. See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below for more about formats
.B mkisofs
supports.
.PP
Note that
.B mkisofs
is not designed to communicate with writers for optical media directly.
Most writers
have proprietary command sets which vary from one manufacturer to
another, and you need a specialized tool like
.B cdrecord
to actually burn the disk.
.PP
The
.B cdrecord
utility is a utility capable of burning an actual disc.  The latest version
of
.B cdrecord
is available from
.B ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord
or
.B ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha
.PP
Also you should know that most cd writers are very particular about timing.
Once you start to burn a disc, you cannot let their buffer empty before you
are done, or you will end up with a corrupt disc.  Thus it is critical
that you be able to maintain an uninterrupted data stream to the writer
for the entire time that the disc is being written.
.SS "Dealing with path names
.PP
.B pathspec
is the path of the directory tree to be copied into the ISO-9660 filesystem.
Multiple paths can be specified, and
.B
mkisofs
will merge the files found in all of the specified path components to form the cdrom
image.
.PP
If the option
.B \-graft\-points
has been specified, 
it is possible to graft the paths at points other than the root
directory, and it is possible to graft files or directories onto the
cdrom image with names different than what they have in the source filesystem.  This is
easiest to illustrate with a couple of examples.   Let's start by assuming that a local
file ../old.lis exists, and you wish to include it in the cdrom image.


	foo/bar/=../old.lis

will include the file old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/old.lis, while

	foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis

will include the file old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/xxx.  The
same sort of syntax can be used with directories as well.
.B mkisofs
will create any directories required such that the graft
points exist on the cdrom image - the directories do not need to
appear in one of the paths.  By default, any directories that are created on 
the fly like this will have permissions 0555 and appear to be owned by the
person running mkisofs.  If you wish other permissions or owners of
the intermediate directories, see 
.BR \-uid , 
.BR \-gid ,
.BR \-dir\-mode ,
.BR \-file\-mode " and
.BR \-new\-dir\-mode .
.PP
.B mkisofs
will also run on Win9\fIx\fP/NT\fIx\fP machines when compiled with Cygnus' cygwin
(available from http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/). Therefore most
references in this man page to
.I Unix
also apply to
.I Win32
or
.IR Win64 .

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-abstract " FILE
Specifies the abstract file name in the primary volume descriptor.
There is space on the disc for 37 characters of information.
The related Joliet entry is limited to 18 characters.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.m\&kisofsrc
with ABST=filename.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.sp
It is up to the user of 
.B mkisofs
to include a file with the apropriate name in the created filesystem tree.
.TP
.BI \-A " application_id
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the application that will be on the disc.  There
is space on the disc for 128 characters of information.
The related Joliet entry is limited to 64 characters.
This parameter can
also be set in the file
.B \&.m\&kisofsrc
with APPI=id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.B \-allow\-leading\-dots
.TP
.B \-ldots
Allow ISO-9660 filenames to begin with a period.  Usually, a leading dot is
replaced with an underscore in order to maintain MS-DOS compatibility.
.br
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-allow\-lowercase
This options allows lower case characters to appear in ISO-9660 filenames.
.br
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work on some systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-allow\-multidot
This options allows more than one dot to appear in ISO-9660 filenames.
A leading dot is not affected by this option, it
may be allowed separately using the
.B \-allow\-leading\-dots
option.
.br
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.BI \-biblio " FILE
Specifies the bibliographic file name in the primary volume descriptor.
There is space on the disc for 37 characters of information.
The related Joliet entry is limited to 18 characters.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.m\&kisofsrc
with BIBLO=filename.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.sp
It is up to the user of 
.B mkisofs
to include a file with the apropriate name in the created filesystem tree.
.TP
.B \-cache\-inodes
Cache inode and device numbers to find hard links to files.
If
.B mkisofs
finds a hard link (a file with multiple names), then the file will only
appear once on the CD. This helps to save space on the CD.
The option
.B \-cache\-inodes
is default on UNIX like operating systems.
Be careful when using this option on a filesystem without unique
inode numbers as it may result in files containing the wrong content on CD.
.sp
If inodes are not cached,
.B mkisofs
will revert to the old Rrip Version-1.10 (see
.BR \-rrip110 )
and
.B mkisofs
will not be able to create
.B "correct inode numbers
for zero sized files.
.TP
.B \-no\-cache\-inodes
Do not cache inode and device numbers.
This option is needed whenever a filesystem does not have unique
inode numbers. It is the default on old
.B Cygwin 
versions.
As the Microsoft operating system that runs below
.B Cygwin
uses 64 bit inode numbers for NTFS, it does not have unique inode numbers
in the 32 bit range.
Old Cygwin versions create fake 32-bit inode numbers from a hash algorithm 
and thus create non-unique numbers.
If
.B mkisofs
would cache inodes on old Cygwin versions, it would believe that some files are
identical although they are not. The result in this case are files
that contain the wrong content if a significant amount of different
files (> ~5000) is in inside the tree that is to be archived.
This does not happen when the
.B \-no\-cache\-inodes
is used, but the disadvantage is that
.B mkisofs
cannot detect hardlinks anymore and the resulting CD image may be larger
than expected.
.sp
If inodes are not cached,
.B mkisofs
will revert to the old Rrip Version-1.10 (see
.BR \-rrip110 )
and
.B mkisofs
will not be able to create
.B "correct inode numbers
for zero sized files.
.TP
.BI \-b " eltorito_boot_image
Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be used when making
an "El Torito" bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to
.B mkisofs.
This option is required to make an "El Torito" bootable CD.
The boot image must be exactly the size of either a 1200, 1440, or a 2880
kB floppy, and
.B mkisofs
will use this size when creating the output ISO-9660
filesystem. It is assumed that the first 512 byte sector should be read
from the boot image (it is essentially emulating a normal floppy drive).
This will work, for example, if the boot image is a LILO based boot floppy.
.sp
If the boot image is not an image of a floppy, you need to add one of the
options:
.BR \-hard\-disk\-boot " or " \-no\-emul\-boot .
If the system should not boot off the emulated disk, use
.BR \-no\-boot .
.sp
If the
.B \-sort
option has not been specified, the boot images are sorted
with low priority (+2) to the beginning of the medium.
If you don't like this, you need to specify a sort weight of 0 for the boot images.
.TP
.B \-eltorito\-alt\-boot
Start with a new set of "El Torito" boot parameters.
This allows to have more than one El Torito boot on a CD.
A maximum of 63 El Torito boot entries may be put on a single CD.

.TP
.BI errctl= " name
.TP
.BI errctl= " error control spec
Add the content from file
.I name
to the error control definitions or add
.I error control spec
to the error control definitions.
More than one error control file and more than one
.I error control spec
as well as a mixture of both forms is possible. 
.sp
The reason for using error control is to make
.B mkisofs
quiet about error conditions that are known to be irrelevant on the quality 
of the created filesystem or to tell 
.B mkisofs
to abort on certain error conditions instead of trying to continue
with the filesystem.
.sp
.ne 6
A typical reason to use error control is to
suppress warnings about growing log files while doing a backup on a
live file system.
Another typical reason to use error control is to tell
.B mkisofs
to abort if e.g. a file could not be archived instead of continuing
to archive other files from a list.
.sp
The error control file contains a set of lines, each starting with a list
of error conditions to be ignored followed by white space followed by a
file name pattern (see 
.BR match (1)
or
.BR patmatch (3)
for more information).
The
.I error control spec
uses the same syntax as a single line from the error control file.
If the file name pattern needs to start with white space, use a backslash
to escape the start of the file name. It is not possible to have new line
characters in the file name pattern.
Whenever an error situation is encountered, 
.B mkisofs
checks the lines in the error control file starting from the top.
If the current error condition is listed on a line in the error control file,
then
.B mkisofs
checks whether the pattern on the rest of the line matches the current file name.
If this is the case, 
.B mkisofs
uses the current error control specification to
control the current error condition.
.sp
The list of error conditions to be handled may use one or more (in this case
separated by a '|' character) identifiers from the list below:
.RS
.TP 12
.B ABORT
If this meta condition is included in an error condition,
.B mkisofs
aborts (exits) as soon as possible after this error condition has been
seen instead of making
.B mkisofs
quiet about the condition.
This error condition flag may only be used together with at another 
error condition or a list of error conditions
(separated by a '|' character).
.TP 12
.B WARN
If this meta condition is included in an error condition,
.B mkisofs
prints the warning about the error condition but the error condition
does not affect the exit code of
.B mkisofs
and the error statistics (which is printed to the end) does not
include the related errors.
This error condition flag may only be used together with at another 
error condition or a list of error conditions
(separated by a '|' character).
The
.B WARN
meta condition has a lower precedence than
.BR ABORT .
.TP 12
.B ALL
This is a shortcut for all error conditions below.
.TP 12
.B STAT
Suppress warnings that 
.B mkisofs
could not 
.BR stat (2)
a file.
.TP
.B GETACL
Suppress warnings about files on which
.B mkisofs
had problems to retrieve the ACL information.
.TP
.B OPEN
Suppress warnings about files that could not be opened.
.TP
.B READ
Suppress warnings read errors on files.
.TP
.B WRITE
Suppress warnings write errors on files.
.TP
.B READLINK
Suppress warnings 
.BR readlink (2)
errors on symbolic links.
.TP
.B GROW
Suppress warnings about files that did grow while they have been
archived.
.TP
.B SHRINK
Suppress warnings about files that did shrink while they have been
archived.
.TP
.B MISSLINK
Suppress warnings about files for which 
.B mkisofs
was unable to archive all hard links.
.TP
.B NAMETOOLONG
Suppress warnings about files that could not be archived because the name of
the file is too long for the archive format.
.TP
.B FILETOOBIG
Suppress warnings about files that could not be archived because the size of
the file is too big for the archive format.
.TP
.B SPECIALFILE
Suppress warnings about files that could not be archived because the file type
is not supported by the archive format.
.TP
.B GETXATTR
Suppress warnings about files on that
.B mkisofs
could not retrieve the extended file attribute information.
.TP
.B SETTIME
Suppress warnings about files on that
.B mkisofs
could not set the time information during extraction.
.TP
.B SETMODE
Suppress warnings about files on that
.B mkisofs
could not set the access modes during extraction.
.TP
.B SECURITY
Suppress warnings about files that
have been skipped on extraction because they have been considered to be a
security risk.
This currently applies to all files that have a '/../' sequence inside
when
.B \-..
has not been specified.
.TP
.B LSECURITY
Suppress warnings about links that
have been skipped on extraction because they have been considered to be a 
security risk.
This currently applies to all link names that start with '/' or
have a '/../' sequence inside when 
.B \-secure\-links
has been specified.
In this case, 
.B mkisofs 
tries to match the link name against the pattern in the error control file.
.TP
.B SAMEFILE
Suppress warnings about links that
have been skipped on extraction because source and target of the link
are pointing to the same file.
If 
.B mkisofs
would not skip these files, it would end up with removing the file completely.
In this case, 
.B mkisofs 
tries to match the link name against the pattern in the error control file.
.TP
.B BADACL
Suppress warnings access control list conversion problems.
.TP
.B SETACL
Suppress warnings about files on that
.B mkisofs
could not set the ACL information during extraction.
.TP
.B SETXATTR
Suppress warnings about files on that
.B mkisofs
could not set the extended file attribute information during extraction.
.RE
.sp
If a specific error condition is ignored, then the error condition is not
only handled in a silent way but also excluded from the error statistics
that are printed at the end of the
.B mkisofs
run.
.sp
Be very careful when using error control as you may ignore any error condition.
If you ignore the wrong error conditions, you may not be able to see real
problems anymore.
.sp
Note that currently only the tags
.BR OPEN ,
.BR READ ,
.BR GROW ,
.BR SHRINK ,
are checked from
.BR mkisofs .

.BI \-B " img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e
.TP
.BI \-sparc\-boot " img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e
Specifies a comma separated list of boot images that are needed to make
a bootable CD for sparc systems.
Partition 0 is used for the ISO-9660 image, the first image file is mapped
to partition 1.
There may be empty fields in the comma separated list.
The maximum number of possible partitions is 8 so it is impossible to specify
more than 7 partition images.
This option is required to make a bootable CD for Sun sparc systems.
If the
.B \-B
or
.B \-sparc\-boot
option has been specified, the first sector of the resulting image will
contain a Sun disk label. This disk label specifies slice 0 for the
ISO-9660 image and slice 1 .\|.\|. slice 7 for the boot images that
have been specified with this option. Byte offset 512 .\|.\|. 8191
within each of the additional boot images must contain a primary boot
that works for the appropriate sparc architecture. The rest of each
of the images usually contains an ufs filesystem that is used primary
kernel boot stage.
.sp
The implemented boot method is the boot method found with SunOS 4.x and SunOS 5.x.
However, it does not depend on SunOS internals but only on properties of
the Open Boot prom. For this reason, it should be usable for any OS
that boots off a sparc system.
.sp
For more information also see the 
.B NOTES
section below.
.sp
If the special filename
.B "..."
is used, the actual and all following boot partitions are mapped to the
previous partition. If
.B mkisofs
is called with
.BI "\-G " image " \-B " ...
all boot partitions are mapped to the partition that contains the ISO-9660
filesystem image and the generic boot image that is located in the first
16 sectors of the disk is used for all architectures.
.TP
.BI \-G " generic_boot_image
Specifies the path and filename of the generic boot image to be used when making
a generic bootable CD.
The
.B generic_boot_image
will be placed on the first 16 sectors of the CD. The first 16 sectors
are the sectors that are located before the ISO-9660 primary volume descriptor.
If this option is used together with the
.B \-sparc\-boot
option, the Sun disk label will overlay the first 512 bytes of the generic
boot image.
.TP
.BI \-hard\-disk\-boot
Specifies that the boot image used to create "El Torito" bootable CDs is
a hard disk image. The hard disk image must begin with a master boot
record that contains a single partition.
.TP
.BI \-no\-emul\-boot
Specifies that the boot image used to create "El Torito" bootable CDs is
a 'no emulation' image. The system will load and execute this image without
performing any disk emulation.
.TP
.BI \-no\-boot
Specifies that the created "El Torito" CD should be marked as not bootable. The
system will provide an emulated drive for the image, but will boot off
a standard boot device.
.TP
.BI \-boot\-load\-seg " segment_address
Specifies the load segment address of the boot image for no-emulation
"El Torito" CDs.
.TP
.BI \-boot\-load\-size " load_sectors
Specifies the number of "virtual" (512-byte) sectors to load in
no-emulation mode.  The default is to load the entire boot file.  Some
BIOSes may have problems if this is not a multiple of 4.
.TP
.BI \-boot\-info\-table
Specifies that a 56-byte table with information of the CD-ROM layout
will be patched in at offset 8 in the boot file.  If this option is
given, the boot file is modified in the source filesystem, so make
sure to make a copy if this file cannot be easily regenerated!  See
the
.B "EL TORITO BOOT INFO TABLE
section for a description of this table.
.TP
.BI \-C " last_sess_start,next_sess_start
This option is needed when
.B mkisofs
is used to create a CDextra or the image of a second session or a 
higher level session for a multi session disk.
The option
.B \-C
takes a pair of two numbers separated by a comma. The first number is the
sector number of the first sector in the last session of the disk
that should be appended to.
The second number is the starting sector number of the new session.
The expected pair of numbers may be retrieved by calling
.B "cdrecord \-msinfo ...
If the
.B \-C
option is used in conjunction with the
.B \-M
option,
.B mkisofs
will create a filesystem image that is intended to be a continuation
of the previous session.
If the
.B \-C
option is used without the
.B \-M
option,
.B mkisofs
will create a filesystem image that is intended to be used for a second
session on a CDextra. This is a multi session CD that holds audio data
in the first session and a ISO-9660 filesystem in the second session.
.TP
.BI \-c " boot_catalog
Specifies the path and filename of the boot catalog to be used when making
an "El Torito" bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source
path specified to
.B mkisofs.
This option is required to make a bootable CD.
This file will be inserted into the output tree and not created
in the source filesystem, so be
sure the specified filename does not conflict with an existing file, as
it will be excluded. Usually a name like "boot.catalog" is
chosen.
.sp
If the
.B \-sort
option has not been specified, the boot catalog sorted
with low priority (+1) to the beginning of the medium.
If you don't like this, you need to specify a sort weight of 0 for the boot catalog.
.TP
.B \-check\-oldnames
Check all filenames imported from old session for compliance with
actual 
.B mkisofs 
ISO-9660 file naming rules.
It his option is not present, only names with a length > 31 are checked
as these files are a hard violation of the ISO-9660 standard.
.TP
.BI \-check\-session " FILE
Check all old sessions for compliance with
actual 
.B mkisofs 
ISO-9660 file naming rules.
This is a high level option that is a combination of the options:
.BI \-M " FILE " "\-C 0,0 \-check\-oldnames
For the parameter 
.I FILE
see description of
.B \-M
option.
.TP
.BI \-copyright " FILE
Specifies the Copyright file name in the primary volume descriptor.
There is space on the disc for 37 characters of information.
The related Joliet entry is limited to 18 characters.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.m\&kisofsrc
with COPY=filename.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.sp
It is up to the user of 
.B mkisofs
to include a file with the apropriate name in the created filesystem tree.
.TP
.B \-d
Omit trailing period from files that do not have a period.
.br
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-D
Do not use deep directory relocation, and instead just pack them in the
way we see them.
.br
If ISO-9660:1999 has not been selected,
this violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-data\-change\-warn
If the size of a file changes while the file is being archived, treat this
condition as a warning only that does not cause
.B mkisofs
to abort.
A warning message is still written if the condition is not otherwise
ignored by another rule from an
.B errctl=
option.
The
.B \-data\-change\-warn
option works as if the last error control option was

Specifying this option automatically enables Rock Ridge extensions.
.TP
.B \-dvd\-video
Generate DVD-Video compliant UDF file system. This is done by sorting the
order of the content of the appropriate files and by adding padding 
between the files if needed.
Note that the sorting only works if the DVD-Video filenames include upper case
characters only.
.br
.br
Note that in order to get a DVD-Video compliant filesystem image, you need
to prepare a DVD-Video compliant directory tree. This means you need to
have a directory VIDEO_TS (all caps) in the root directory of the resulting DVD
and you should have a directory AUDIO_TS. The directory VIDEO_TS needs to
include all needed files (file names must be all caps) for a compliant DVD-Video
filesystem.
.TP
.B \-f
Follow all symbolic links when generating the filesystem.  When this option is not

.B \-find
This option acts a separator.
If it is used, all

consumer, which is archiving engine.
If the
.B find
expression evaluated as TRUE, then the related file is selected for
processing, otherwise it is omited.
.sp
In order to make the evaluation of the

.B mkisofs
implements additional
.B "find primaries
that have side effects on the file meta data.
.B Mkisofs
implements the following additional
.B find

.BI \-chmod " mode
The primary always evaluates as true;
it sets the permissions of the file to
.IR mode .
Octal and symbolic permissions are accepted for

as with
.BR chmod (1).
.TP
.BI \-chown " uname
The primary always evaluates as true;
it sets the owner of the file to

This option only makes the visible tree better to understand for
people who don't know what this directory is for.
If you need to have no
.B RR_MOVED

.BI \-input\-charset " charset
Set up the input charset that defines the characters used in local file names.
To get a list of valid charset names, call
.B "mkisofs \-input\-charset help.
To get a 1:1 mapping, you may use
.B default
as charset name. If the input charset has not been set up from the
locale in the environment, the default initial values are
.I cp437
on DOS based systems and
.I iso8859-1
on all other systems.
See 
.B "CHARACTER SETS
section below for more details.
.sp
If
.B \-input\-charset
has not been specified, it will be set up from the locale in the

the empty string as locale name.
.TP
.BI \-output\-charset " charset
Set up the output charset that defines the characters that will be used in Rock Ridge
file names. Defaults to the input charset. See
.B "CHARACTER SETS
section below for more details.
.TP
.BI \-iso\-level " level
Set the ISO-9660 conformance level. Valid numbers are 1..3 and 4.
.sp
With level 1, files may only consist of one section and filenames are
restricted to 8.3 characters.
.sp
With level 2, files may only consist of one section.
.sp
With level 3, no restrictions (other than ISO-9660:1988) do apply.
Starting with this level, mkisofs also allows files to be larger than 4 GB
by implementing ISO-9660 multi-extent files.
.sp
With all ISO-9660 levels from 1..3, all filenames are restricted to upper
case letters, numbers and the underscore (_). The maximum filename
length is restricted to 31 characters, the directory nesting level
is restricted to 8 and the maximum path length is limited to 255 characters.
.sp
Level 4 officially does not exists but 
.B mkisofs
maps it to ISO-9660:1999 which is ISO-9660 version 2.
.sp
With level 4, an enhanced volume descriptor with version number
and file structure version number set to 2 is emitted.
There may be more than 8 levels of directory nesting,
there is no need for a file to contain a dot and the dot has no
more special meaning,
file names do not have version numbers,
.\" (f XXX ??? The character used for filling byte positions which are
.\"     specified to be characters is subject to agreement between the
.\"     originator and the recipient of the volume),
the maximum length for files and directory is raised to 207.
If Rock Ridge is used, the maximum ISO-9660 name length is reduced to 197.
.sp
When creating Version 2 images,
.B mkisofs
emits an enhanced volume descriptor which looks similar to a primary volume
descriptor but is slightly different. Be careful not to use broken software
to make ISO-9660 images bootable by assuming a second PVD copy and patching 
this putative PVD copy into an El Torito VD.
.TP
.B \-J
Generate Joliet directory records in addition to regular ISO-9660 file
names.  This is primarily useful when the discs are to be used on Windows-NT
or Windows-95 machines.  The Joliet filenames are specified in Unicode and
each path component can be up to 64 Unicode characters long.
Note that Joliet is no standard - CD's that use only Joliet extensions but no
standard Rock Ridge extensions may usually only be used on Microsoft Win32
systems. Furthermore, the fact that the filenames are limited to 64 characters
and the fact that Joliet uses the UTF-16 coding for Unicode characters causes
interoperability problems.
.TP
.B \-joliet\-long
Allow Joliet filenames to be up to 103 Unicode characters. This breaks the
Joliet specification - but appears to work. Use with caution. The number
103 is derived from: the maximum Directory Record Length (254), minus the
length of Directory Record (33), minus CD-ROM XA System Use Extension
Information (14), divided by the UTF-16 character size (2).
.TP
.BI \-jcharset " charset
Same as using
.B \-input\-charset
.I charset
and
.B \-J
options. See
.B "CHARACTER SETS
section below for more details.
.TP
.B \-l
Allow full 31 character filenames.  Normally the ISO-9660 filename will be in an
8.3 format which is compatible with MS-DOS, even though the ISO-9660 standard
allows filenames of up to 31 characters.  If you use this option, the disc may
be difficult to use on a MS-DOS system, but this comes in handy on some other
systems (such as the Amiga).
Use with caution.
.TP
.B \-L
Outdated option reserved by POSIX.1-2001, use
.B \-allow\-leading\-dots
instead.
This option will get POSIX.1-2001 semantics with mkisofs-2.02.
.TP
.BI \-log\-file " log_file
Redirect all error, warning and informational messages to
.I log_file
instead of the standard error.
.TP
.BI \-m " glob
Exclude
.I glob
from being written to CDROM.
.I glob
is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match part of the filename (not 
the path as with option
.BR \-x ).
Technically
.I glob
is matched against the
.I d->d_name
part of the directory entry.
Multiple globs may be excluded.
Example:

mkisofs \-o rom \-m '*.o' \-m core \-m foobar

would exclude all files ending in ".o", called "core" or "foobar" to be
copied to CDROM. Note that if you had a directory called "foobar" it too (and
of course all its descendants) would be excluded.
.sp
NOTE: The
.B \-m
and
.B \-x
option description should both be updated, they are wrong.
Both now work identical and use filename globbing. A file is excluded if either
the last component matches or the whole path matches.
.TP
.BI \-exclude\-list " file
A file containing a list of
.I globs
to be exclude as above.
.TP
.B \-max\-ISO-9660\-filenames
Allow 37 chars in ISO-9660 filenames.
This option forces the
.B \-N
option as the extra name space is taken from the space reserved for
ISO-9660 version numbers.
.br
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Although a conforming application needs to provide a buffer space of at
least 37 characters, disks created with this option may cause a buffer
overflow in the reading operating system. Use with extreme care.
.TP
.BI \-M " path
or
.TP
.BI \-M " device
or
.TP
.BI \-dev " device
Specifies path to existing ISO-9660 image to be merged. The alternate form
takes a SCSI device specifier that uses the same syntax as the
.B "dev=
parameter of
.B cdrecord.
The output of 
.B mkisofs
will be a new session which should get written to the end of the
image specified in \-M.  Typically this requires multi-session capability
for the recorder and cdrom drive that you are attempting to write this
image to.
This option may only be used in conjunction with the
.B \-C
option.
.TP
.B \-N
Omit version numbers from ISO-9660 file names.
.br
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but no one really uses the
version numbers anyway.
Use with caution.
.TP
.BI \-new\-dir\-mode " mode
Mode to use when creating new directories in the iso fs image.  The default
mode is 0555.
.TP
.B \-nobak
.TP
.B \-no\-bak
Do not include backup files files on the ISO-9660 filesystem.
If the
.B \-no\-bak
option is specified, files that contain the characters '~' or '#'
or end in '.bak' will not be included (these are typically backup files
for editors under unix).
.TP
.B \-no\-limit\-pathtables
A ISO-9660 filesystem contains path tables that contain a list of directories.
This list may contain many directories but only 65535 of them may be parent
directories.
When
.B \-no\-limit\-pathtables 
is in use, further parent directories will be folded to the root directory
and the resulting filesystem will no longer be usable on
.BR DOS .
.TP
.B \-force\-rr
Do not use the automatic Rock Ridge attributes recognition for previous sessions.
This helps to show rotten ISO-9660 extension records as e.g. created by NERO burning ROM.
.TP
.B \-no\-rr
Do not use the Rock Ridge attributes from previous sessions.
This may help to avoid getting into trouble when
.B mkisofs
finds illegal Rock Ridge signatures on an old session.
.TP
.B \-no\-split\-symlink\-components
Don't split the SL components, but begin a new Continuation Area (CE)
instead. This may waste some space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 cdrom driver
has a bug in reading split SL components (link_size = component_size 
instead of link_size += component_size).
.sp
Note that this option has been introduced by Eric Youngdale in 1997.
It is questionable whether it makes sense at all.
When it has been introduced,
.B mkisofs 
did have a serious bug that did create defective CE signatures if
a symlink contained `/../'.
This CE signature bug in
.B mkisofs
has been fixed in May 2003.
.TP
.B \-no\-split\-symlink\-fields
Don't split the SL fields, but begin a new Continuation Area (CE)
instead. This may waste some space, but the SunOS 4.1.4 and
Solaris 2.5.1 cdrom driver have a bug in reading split SL fields
(a `/' can be dropped).
.sp

.TP
.BI \-o " filename
is the name of the file to which the ISO-9660 filesystem image should be
written.  This can be a disk file, a tape drive, or it can correspond directly
to the device name of the optical disc writer.  If not specified, stdout is
used.  Note that the output can also be a block special device for a regular
disk drive, in which case the disk partition can be mounted and examined to
ensure that the premastering was done correctly.
.TP
.B \-pad
Pad the end of the whole image by 150 sectors (300 kB).
If the option
.B \-B
is used, then there is a padding at the end of the ISO-9660 partition 
and before the beginning of the boot partitions.
The size of this padding is chosen to make the first boot partition start
on a sector number that is a multiple of 16.
.sp
The padding is needed as many operating systems (e.g. Linux)
implement read ahead bugs in their filesystem I/O. These bugs result in read
errors on one or more files that are located at the end of a track. They are
usually present when the CD is written in Track at Once mode or when
the disk is written as mixed mode CD where an audio track follows the
data track.
.sp
To avoid problems with I/O error on the last file on the filesystem,
the 
.B \-pad
option has been made the default.
.TP
.B \-no\-pad
Do not Pad the end by 150 sectors (300 kB) and do not make the the boot partitions
start on a multiple of 16 sectors.
.TP
.BI \-path\-list " file
A file containing a list of
.I pathspec
directories and filenames to be added to the ISO-9660 filesystem. This list
of pathspecs are processed after any that appear on the command line. If the
argument is
.IR \- ,
then the list is read from the standard input.
.TP
.B \-P
Outdated option reserved by POSIX.1-2001, use
.B \-publisher
instead.
This option will get POSIX.1-2001 semantics with mkisofs-2.02.
.TP
.BI \-publisher " publisher_id
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the publisher of the CDROM, usually with a
mailing address and phone number.  There is space on the disc for 128
characters of information.
The related Joliet entry is limited to 64 characters.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.m\&kisofsrc
with PUBL=.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-p " preparer_id
Specifies a text string that will be written into the volume header.
This should describe the preparer of the CDROM, usually with a mailing
address and phone number.  There is space on the disc for 128
characters of information.
The related Joliet entry is limited to 64 characters.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.m\&kisofsrc
with PREP=.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.B \-posix\-H
Follow all symbolic links encountered on command line when generating the filesystem.
.TP
.B \-posix\-L
Follow all symbolic links when generating the filesystem.
When this option is not in use, symbolic links will be entered using
Rock Ridge if enabled, otherwise the file will be ignored.
.TP
.B \-posix\-P
Do not follow symbolic links when generating the filesystem (this is the default).
If
.B \-posix\-P
is specified after
.B \-posix\-H
or
.BR \-posix\-L ,
the effect of these options will be reset. 
.TP
.B \-print\-size
Print estimated filesystem size in multiples of the sector size (2048 bytes)
and exit. This option is needed for
Disk At Once mode and with some CD-R drives when piping directly into
.B cdrecord.
In this case it is needed to know the size of the filesystem before the
actual CD-creation is done.
The option \-print\-size allows to get this size from a "dry-run" before
the CD is actually written.
Old versions of
.B mkisofs
did write this information (among other information) to 
.IR stderr .
As this turns out to be hard to parse, the number without any other information
is now printed on 
.B stdout
too.
If you like to write a simple shell script, redirect
.B stderr
and catch the number from
.BR stdout .
This may be done with:
.sp
.B "cdblocks=` mkisofs \-print\-size \-quiet .\|.\|. `
.sp
.B "mkisofs .\|.\|. | cdrecord .\|.\|. tsize=${cdblocks}s -"
.TP
.B \-quiet
This makes
.B mkisofs
even less verbose.  No progress output will be provided.
.TP
.B \-R
Generate SUSP and RR records using the Rock Ridge protocol to further describe
the files on the ISO-9660 filesystem.
The Rock Ridge protocol is needed in order to add POSIX like file meta data
like permissions, extended time stamps, user/group is'd, link counts, inode numbers
and symbolic links. The Rock Ridge protocol allows to archive hierarchy trees
with unlimited depth.
.TP
.B \-r
This is like the \-R option, but file ownership and modes are set to
more useful values.  The uid and gid are set to zero, because they are
usually only useful on the author's system, and not useful to the
client.  All the file read bits are set true, so that files and
directories are globally readable on the client.  If any execute bit is
set for a file, set all of the execute bits, so that executables are
globally executable on the client.  If any search bit is set for a
directory, set all of the search bits, so that directories are globally
searchable on the client.  All write bits are cleared, because the
CD-Rom will be mounted read-only in any case.  If any of the special
mode bits are set, clear them, because file locks are not useful on a
read-only file system, and set-id bits are not desirable for uid 0 or
gid 0.
When used on Win32, the execute bit is set on
.I all
files. This is a result of the lack of file permissions on Win32 and the
Cygwin POSIX emulation layer.  See also \-uid \-gid, \-dir\-mode, \-file\-mode
and \-new\-dir\-mode.
.TP
.B \-relaxed\-filenames
The option
.B \-relaxed\-filenames
allows ISO-9660 filenames to include digits, upper case characters
and all other 7 bit ASCII characters (resp. anything except lowercase
characters).
.br
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.BI \-root " dir
Moves all files and directories into
.I dir
in the image. This is essentially the
same as using 
.B -graft-points
and adding
.I dir
in front of every pathspec, but is easier to use.

.I dir
may actually be several levels deep. It is
created with the same permissions as other graft points.
.TP
.B \-rrip110
Create ISO-9660 file system images that follow the old Rrip Version-1.10 standard
from 1993. This option may be needed if you know of systems that do not implement
the Rrip protocol correctly and like the file system to be read by such a system.
Currently no such system is known.
.sp
If a file system has been created with
.BR \-rrip110 ,
the Rock Ridge attributes do not include inode number information.
.TP
.B \-rrip112
Create ISO-9660 file system images that follow the new Rrip Version-1.12 standard
from 1994, this is the default.
.TP
.BI \-old-root " dir
This option is necessary when writing a multisession
image and the previous (or even older) session was written with
.BI -root " dir.
Using a directory name not found in the previous session
causes
.B mkisofs
to abort with an error.

Without this option,
.B mkisofs
would not be able to find unmodified files and would
be forced to write their data into the image once more.

.B \-root
and
.B \-old-root
are meant to be used together to do incremental backups.
The initial session would e.g. use:
.BI "mkisofs \-root backup_1 " dirs\f0.
The next incremental backup with
.BI "mkisofs \-root backup_2 \-old-root backup_1 " dirs\f0.
would take another snapshot of these directories. The first
snapshot would be found in
.BR backup_1 ,
the second one in
.BR backup_2 ,
but only modified or new files need to be written
into the second session.

Without these options, new files would be added and old ones would be
preserved. But old ones would be overwritten if the file was
modified. Recovering the files by copying the whole directory back
from CD would also restore files that were deleted
intentionally. Accessing several older versions of a file requires
support by the operating system to choose which sessions are to be
mounted.

.BI \-sort " sort file
Sort file locations on the media. Sorting is controlled by a file that
contains pairs of filenames and sorting offset weighting.
If the weighting is higher, the file will be located closer to the
beginning of the media, if the weighting is lower, the file will be located
closer to the end of the media. There must be only one space or tabs
character between the filename and the
weight and the weight must be the last characters on a line. The filename
is taken to include all the characters up to, but not including the last
space or tab character on a line. This is to allow for space characters to
be in, or at the end of a filename.
This option does
.B not
sort the order of the file names that appear
in the ISO-9660 directory. It sorts the order in which the file data is
written to the CD image - which may be useful in order to optimize the
data layout on a CD. See README.sort for more details.
.TP
.BI \-sparc\-boot " img_sun4,img_sun4c,img_sun4m,img_sun4d,img_sun4e
See
.B \-B
option above.
.TP
.BI \-sparc\-label " label
Set the Sun disk label name for the Sun disk label that is created with the
.B \-sparc-boot
option.
.TP
.B \-split\-output
Split the output image into several files of approximately 1 GB.
This helps to create DVD sized ISO-9660 images on operating systems without
large file support.
Cdrecord will concatenate more than one file into a single track if writing
to a DVD.
To make
.B \-split\-output
work, the 
.BI \-o " filename"
option must be specified. The resulting output images will be named:
.IR filename_00 , filename_01, filename_02 ...
.TP
.BI \-stream\-media\-size " #
Select streaming operation and set the media size to # sectors.
This allows you to pipe the output of the tar program into mkisofs
and to create a ISO-9660 filesystem without the need of an intermediate
tar archive file. 
If this option has been specified,
.B mkisofs
reads from 
.B stdin 
and creates a file with the name
.BR STREAM.IMG .
The maximum size of the file (with padding) is 200 sectors less than the 
specified media size. If 
.B \-no\-pad
has been specified, the file size is 50 sectors less than the specified media size.
If the file is smaller, then mkisofs will write padding. This may take a while.
.sp
The option 
.B \-stream\-media\-size
creates simple ISO-9660 filesystems only and may not used together with multi-session
or hybrid filesystem options.
.TP
.BI \-stream\-file\-name " name
Set the file name used with 
.BI \-stream\-media\-size " #
to a value different from
.BR STREAM.IMG .
If this option is used, the filesystem is created as if 
.BR \-iso\-level " 4
has been specified.
.TP
.BI \-sunx86\-boot " UFS-img,,,AUX1-img
Specifies a comma separated list of filesystem images that are needed to make
a bootable CD for Solaris x86 systems.
.sp
Note that partition 1 is used for the ISO-9660 image and that partition 2 is
the whole disk, so partition 1 and 2 may not be used by external partition data.
The first image file is mapped to partition 0.
There may be empty fields in the comma separated list,
and list entries for partition 1 and 2 must be empty.
The maximum number of supported partitions is 8 (although the Solaris x86
partition table could support up to 16 partitions), so it is impossible
to specify more than 6 partition images.
This option is required to make a bootable CD for Solaris x86 systems.
.sp
If the
.B \-sunx86\-boot
option has been specified, the first sector of the resulting image will
contain a PC fdisk label with a Solaris type 0x82 fdisk partition that
starts at offset 512 and spans the whole CD.
In addition, for the Solaris type 0x82 fdisk partition, there is a
SVr4 disk label at offset 1024 in the first sector of the CD.
This disk label specifies slice 0 for the first (usually UFS type)
filesystem image that is used to boot the PC and slice 1 for
the ISO-9660 image.
Slice 2 spans the whole CD slice 3 .\|.\|. slice 7 may be used for additional
filesystem images that have been specified with this option.
.sp
A Solaris x86 boot CD uses a 1024 byte sized primary boot that uses the
.B "El-Torito no-emulation 
boot mode and a secondary generic boot that is in CD sectors 1\|.\|.15.
For this reason, both
.BI "-b " bootimage " -no\-emul\-boot
and
.BI \-G " genboot
must be specified.
.TP
.BI \-sunx86\-label " label
Set the SVr4 disk label name for the SVr4 disk label that is created with the
.B \-sunx86-boot
option.
.TP
.BI \-sysid " ID
Specifies the system ID.
There is space on the disc for 32 characters of information.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.m\&kisofsrc
with SYSI=system_id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.B \-T
Generate a file TRANS.TBL in each directory on the CDROM, which can be used
on non-Rock Ridge capable systems to help establish the correct file names.
There is also information present in the file that indicates the major and
minor numbers for block and character devices, and each symlink has the name of
the link file given.
.TP
.BI \-table\-name " TABLE_NAME
Alternative translation table file name (see above). Implies the
.B \-T
option.
If you are creating a multi-session image you must use the same name
as in the previous session.
.TP
.BI \-ucs\-level " level
Set Unicode conformance level in the Joliet SVD. The default level is 3.
It may be set to 1..3 using this option.
.TP
.B \-UDF
Include a
.B UDF
hybrid in the generated filesystem image.
As
.B mkisofs
always creates a ISO-9660 filesystem,
it is not possible to create UDF only images. 
Note that 
.B UDF
wastes the space from sector ~20 to sector 256 at the beginning of the disk
in addition to the spcae needed for real 
.B UDF 
data structures.
.TP
.B \-udf
Rationalized UDF with user and group set to 0 and with simplified permissions.
See
.B \-r
option for more information.
.TP
.B \-udf\-symlinks
Support symlinks in 
.B UDF
filesystems. This is the default.
.TP
.B \-no\-udf\-symlinks
Do not support symlinks in
.B UDF
filesystems.
.TP
.BI \-uid " uid
Overrides the uid read from the source files to the value of
.IR uid . 
Specifying this option automatically enables Rock Ridge extensions.
.TP
.B \-use\-fileversion
The option 
.B \-use\-fileversion
allows mkisofs to use file version numbers from the filesystem.
If the option is not specified, 
.B mkisofs
creates a version number of 1 for all files.
File versions are strings in the range 
.I ";1"
to
.I ";32767"
This option is the default on VMS. 
.TP
.B \-U
Allows "Untranslated" filenames, completely violating the ISO-9660 standards
described above. Forces on the \-d, \-l, \-N, \-allow\-leading\-dots,
\-relaxed\-filenames,
\-allow\-lowercase, \-allow\-multidot and \-no\-iso\-translate
flags. It allows more
than one '.' character in the filename, as well as mixed case filenames.
This is useful on HP-UX system, where the built-in CDFS filesystem does
not recognize ANY extensions. Use with extreme caution.
.TP
.B \-no\-iso\-translate
Do not translate the characters '#' and '~' which are invalid for ISO-9660 filenames.
These characters are though invalid often used by Microsoft systems.
.br
This violates the ISO-9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems.
Use with caution.
.TP
.BI \-V " volid
Specifies the volume ID (volume name or label) to be written into the
master block. 
There is space on the disc for 32 characters of information.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.m\&kisofsrc
with VOLI=id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.  Note that
if you assign a volume ID, this is the name that will be used as the mount
point used by the Solaris volume management system and the name that is
assigned to the disc on a Microsoft Win32 or Apple Mac platform.
.TP
.BI \-volset " ID
Specifies the volset ID.
There is space on the disc for 128 characters of information.
The related Joliet entry is limited to 64 characters.
This parameter can also be set in the file
.B \&.m\&kisofsrc
with VOLS=volset_id.
If specified in both places, the command line version is used.
.TP
.BI \-volset\-size " #
Sets the volume set size to #.
The volume set size is the number of CD's that are in a CD volume set.
A volume set is a collection of one or more volumes, on which a set of
files is recorded.
.sp
Volume Sets are not intended to be used to create a set numbered CD's
that are part of e.g. a Operation System installation set of CD's.
Volume Sets are rather used to record a big directory tree that would not
fit on a single volume.
Each volume of a Volume Set contains a description of all the directories
and files that are recorded on the volumes where the sequence numbers
are less than, or equal to, the assigned Volume Set Size of the current
volume.
.sp
.B Mkisofs
currently does not support a
.B \-volset\-size
that is larger than 1.
.sp
The option
.B \-volset\-size
must be specified before
.B \-volset\-seqno
on each command line.
.TP
.BI \-volset\-seqno " #
Sets the volume set sequence number to #.
The volume set sequence number is the index number of the current
CD in a CD set.
The option
.B \-volset\-size
must be specified before
.B \-volset\-seqno
on each command line.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose execution. If given twice on the command line, extra debug information
will be printed.
.TP
.BI \-x " path
Exclude
.I path
from being written to CDROM.
.I path
must be the complete pathname that results from concatenating the pathname
given as command line argument and the path relative to this directory.
Multiple paths may be excluded.
Example: 

mkisofs \-o cd \-x /local/dir1 \-x /local/dir2 /local
.sp
NOTE: The
.B \-m
and
.B \-x
option description should both be updated, they are wrong.
Both now work identical and use filename globbing. A file is excluded if either
the last component matches or the whole path matches.
.TP
.B \-XA
Generate XA iso-directory attributes with original owner and mode information.
This option is required to create conforming multi session CDs as used by the
Kodak Photo CD and the Kodak Picture CD.
A conforming XA CD uses CD-ROM XA mode 1 sectors, see the
.BI \-sector " xa2
option for more information.
.TP
.B \-xa
Generate XA iso-directory attributes with rationalized owner and mode information.
User ID and group ID are set to 0.
See
.B \-XA
for more information.
.TP
.B \-z
Generate special RRIP records for transparently compressed files.
This is only of use and interest for hosts that support transparent
decompression, such as Linux 2.4.14 or later.  You must specify the
.B \-R
or
.B \-r
options to enable RockRidge, and generate compressed files using the
.B mkzftree
utility before running
.BR mkisofs .
Note that transparent compression is a nonstandard Rock Ridge extension.
The resulting disks are only transparently readable if used on Linux.
On other operating systems you will need to call
.B mkzftree
by hand to decompress the files.

.SH "HFS OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-hfs
Create an ISO-9660/HFS hybrid CD. This option should be used in conjunction
with the
.BR \-map ,
.B \-magic
and/or the various
.I double dash
options given below.
.TP
.B \-no\-hfs
Do not create an ISO-9660/HFS hybrid CD even though other options may imply to do so. 
.TP
.B \-apple
Create an ISO-9660 CD with Apple's extensions. Similar to the
.B \-hfs
option, except that the Apple Extensions to ISO-9660 are added instead of
creating an HFS hybrid volume.
Former 
.B mkisofs
versions did include Rock Ridge attributes by default if 
.B \-apple
was specified. This versions of
.B mkisofs
does not do this anymore. If you like to have Rock Ridge attributes,
you need to specify this separately.
.TP
.BI \-map " mapping_file
Use the
.I mapping_file
to set the CREATOR and TYPE information for a file based on the
filename's extension. A filename is 
mapped only if it is not one of the know Apple/Unix file formats. See the
.B "HFS CREATOR/TYPE
section below.
.TP
.BI \-magic " magic_file
The CREATOR and TYPE information is set by using a file's
.I magic number
(usually the first few bytes of a file). The
.I magic_file
is only used if a file is not one of the known Apple/Unix file formats, or
the filename extension has not been mapped using the
.B \-map
option. See the 
.B "HFS CREATOR/TYPE
section below for more details.
.TP
.BI \-hfs\-creator " CREATOR
Set the default CREATOR for all files. Must be exactly 4 characters. See the
.B "HFS CREATOR/TYPE
section below for more details.
.TP
.BI \-hfs\-type " TYPE
Set the default TYPE for all files. Must be exactly 4 characters. See the
.B "HFS CREATOR/TYPE
section below for more details.
.TP
.B \-probe
Search the contents of files for all the known Apple/Unix file formats.
See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below for more about these formats.
However, the only way to check for
.I MacBinary
and
.I AppleSingle
files is to open and read them. Therefore this option
.I may
increase processing time. It is better to use one or more
.I double dash
options given below if the Apple/Unix formats in use are known.
.TP
.B \-no\-desktop
Do not create (empty) Desktop files. New HFS Desktop files will be created
when the CD is used on a Macintosh (and stored in the System Folder).
By default, empty Desktop files are added to the HFS volume.
.TP
.B \-mac\-name
Use the HFS filename as the starting point for the ISO-9660, Joliet and
Rock Ridge file names. See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE NAMES
section below for more information.
.TP
.BI \-boot\-hfs\-file " driver_file
Installs the
.I driver_file
that
.I may
make the CD bootable on a Macintosh. See the
.B HFS BOOT DRIVER
section below. (Alpha).
.TP
.B \-part
Generate an HFS partition table. By default, no partition table is generated,
but some older Macintosh CDROM drivers need an HFS partition table on the
CDROM to be able to recognize a hybrid CDROM.
.TP
.BI \-auto " AutoStart_file
Make the HFS CD use the QuickTime 2.0 Autostart feature to launch an
application or document. The given filename must be the name of a document or
application located at the top level of the CD. The filename must be less
than 12 characters. (Alpha).
.TP
.BI \-cluster\-size " size
Set the size in bytes of the cluster or allocation units of PC Exchange
files. Implies the
.B \-\-exchange
option. See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section below.
.TP
.BI \-hide\-hfs " glob
Hide
.I glob
from the HFS volume. The file or directory will still exist in the
ISO-9660 and/or Joliet directory.
.I glob
is a shell wild-card-style pattern that must match any part of the filename
Multiple globs may be excluded.
Example:

mkisofs \-o rom \-hfs \-hide\-hfs '*.o' \-hide\-hfs foobar

would exclude all files ending in ".o" or called "foobar" 
from the HFS volume. Note that if you had a directory called
"foobar" it too (and of course all its descendants) would be excluded.
The
.I glob
can also be a path name relative to the source directories given on the
command line. Example:

mkisofs \-o rom \-hfs \-hide\-hfs src/html src

would exclude just the file or directory called "html" from the "src"
directory. Any other file or directory called "html" in the tree will
not be excluded.
Should be used with the
.B \-hide
and/or
.B \-hide\-joliet
options.
In order to match a directory name, make sure the pathname does not include
a trailing '/' character. See README.hide for more details.
.TP
.BI \-hide\-hfs\-list " file
A file containing a list of
.I globs
to be hidden as above.
.TP
.BI \-hfs\-volid " hfs_volid
Volume name for the HFS partition. This is the name that is
assigned to the disc on a Macintosh and replaces the
.I volid
used with the 
.B \-V

.TP
.B \-icon\-position
Use the icon position information, if it exists, from the Apple/Unix file.
The icons will appear in the same position as they would on a Macintosh
desktop. Folder location and size on screen, its scroll positions, folder
View (view as Icons, Small Icons, etc.) are also preserved.
This option may become set by default in the future.
(Alpha).

.SH "CHARACTER SETS
.B mkisofs
processes file names in a POSIX compliant way as strings of 8-bit characters.
To represent all codings for all languages, 8-bit characters are not
sufficient. Unicode or
.B ISO-10646
define character codings that need at least 21 bits to represent all
known languages. They may be represented with
.BR UTF-32 ", " UTF-16 " or " UTF-8
coding.
.B UTF-32
uses a plain 32-bit coding but seems to be uncommon. 
.B UCS-2
is used by Microsoft with Win32.
This coding is similar to 
.B UTF-16
with the disadvantage that it only supports
a 16 bit subset of all codes and that 16-bit characters are not compliant with
the POSIX filesystem interface.
.PP
Modern UNIX operating systems may use
.B UTF-8
coding for filenames. This coding allows to use the complete Unicode code set.
Each 32-bit character is represented by one or more 8-bit characters.
If a character is coded in
.B ISO-8859-1
(used in Central Europe and North America) is maps 1:1 to a 
.BR UTF-32 " or " UTF-16 "
coded Unicode character.
If a character is coded in
.B "7-Bit ASCII
(used in USA and other countries with limited character set)
is maps 1:1 to a 
.BR UTF-32 ", " UTF-16 " or " UTF-8
coded Unicode character.
Character codes that cannot be represented as a single byte in UTF-8
(typically if the value is > 0x7F) use escape sequences that map to more than
one 8-bit character.
.PP
If all operating systems would use 
.B UTF-8
coding,
.B mkisofs
would not need to recode characters in file names.
Unfortunately, Apple uses completely nonstandard codings and Microsoft
uses a Unicode coding that is not compatible with the POSIX filename
interface.
.PP
For all non
.B UTF-8
coded operating systems, the actual character
that each byte represents depends on the
.I character set
or
.I codepage
(which is the name used by Microsoft)
used by the local operating system in use - the characters in a character
set will reflect the region or natural language used by the user.
.PP
Usually character codes 0x00-0x1f are control characters, codes 0x20-0x7f
are the 7 bit ASCII characters and (on PC's and Mac's) 0x80-0xff are used
for other characters.
Unfortunately even this does not follow ISO standards that reserve the
range 0x80-0x9f for control characters and only allow 0xa0-0xff for other
characters.
.PP
As there is a lot more than 256 characters/symbols in use, only a small
subset are represented in a character set. Therefore the same character code
may represent a different character in different character sets. So a file name
generated, say in central Europe, may not display the same character
when viewed on a machine in, say eastern Europe.
.PP
To make matters more complicated, different operating systems use
different character sets for the region or language. For example the character
code for "small e with acute accent" may be character code 0x82 on a PC, 
code 0x8e on a Macintosh and code 0xe9 on a UNIX system.
Note while the codings used on a PC or Mac are nonstandard,
Unicode codes this character as 0x00000000e9 which is basically the
same value as the value used by most UNIX systems.
.PP
As long as not all operating systems and applications will use the Unicode
character set as the basis for file names in a unique way, it may be
necessary to specify which character set your file names use in and which
character set the file names should appear on the CD.
.PP
There are four options to specify the character sets you want to use:
.IP \-input\-charset
Defines the local character set you are using on your host machine.
Any character set conversions that take place will use this character
set as the staring point. The default input character sets are
.I cp437
on DOS based systems and
.I iso8859-1
on all other systems.

If the
.I \-J
option is given, then the Unicode equivalents of the input character set
will be used in the Joliet directory. Using the 
.I \-jcharset
option is the same as using the
.I \-input\-charset
and
.I \-J
options.
.IP \-output\-charset
Defines the character set that will be used with for the Rock Ridge names
on the CD. Defaults to the input character set. Only likely to be useful
if used on a non-Unix platform. e.g. using
.B mkisofs
on a Microsoft Win32 machine to create Rock Ridge CDs. If you are using
.B mkisofs
on a Unix machine, it is likely that the output character set
will be the same as the input character set.
.IP \-input\-hfs\-charset
Defines the HFS character set used for HFS file names decoded from
any of the various Apple/Unix file formats. Only useful when used with
.I \-mac\-name
option. See the
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE NAMES
for more information. Defaults to
.I cp10000
(Mac Roman).
.IP \-output\-hfs\-charset
Defines the HFS character set used to create HFS file names from the input
character set in use. In most cases this will be from the character set
given with the
.I \-input\-charset
option. Defaults to the input HFS character set.
.PP
There are a number of character sets built in to
.IR mkisofs .
To get a listing, use
.B "mkisofs \-input\-charset help.
.PP
Additional character sets from
.BR iconv (1)
may be used on systems, that support
.BR iconv (1).
In this case, call
.B "iconv \-l
to get a list of valid character sets from this coding method.
To force an 
.BR iconv (1)
based coding, use
.BI iconv: name
instead of 
.I name
for the character set.
.PP
If using non
.BR iconv (1)
based character sets,
additional character sets can be read from file for any of the character
set options by giving a filename as the argument to the options. The given
file will only be read if its name does not match one of the built in
character sets.
.PP
The format of the character set files is the same as the mapping files
available from http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS The format of these
files is:

	Column #1 is the input byte code (in hex as 0xXX)
.br
	Column #2 is the Unicode (in hex as 0xXXXX)
.br
	Rest of the line is ignored.

Any blank line, line without two (or more) columns in the above format
or comments lines (starting with the # character) are ignored without any
warnings. Any missing input code is mapped to Unicode character 0x0000.
.PP
Note that there is no support for 16 bit UNICODE (UTF-16) or 32 bit UNICODE
(UTF-32) coding because this coding is not POSIX compliant. There should 
be support for UTF-8 UNICODE coding which is compatible to POSIX filenames
and supported by moder UNIX implementations such as Solaris.
.PP
A 1:1 character set mapping can be defined by using the keyword
.I default
as the argument to any of the character set options. This is the behaviour
of older (v1.12) versions of
.BR mkisofs .
.PP
The ISO-9660 file names generated from the input filenames are not converted
from the input character set. The ISO-9660 character set is a very limited
subset of the ASCII characters, so any conversion would be pointless.
.PP
Any character that
.B mkisofs
can not convert will be replaced with a '_' character.
.PP
.SH "HFS CREATOR/TYPE
A Macintosh file has two properties associated with it which define
which application created the file, the
.I CREATOR
and what data the file contains, the
.IR TYPE .
Both are (exactly) 4 letter strings. Usually this
allows a Macintosh user to double-click on a file and launch the correct
application etc. The CREATOR and TYPE of a particular file can be found by
using something like ResEdit (or similar) on a Macintosh.
.LP
The CREATOR and TYPE information is stored in all the various Apple/Unix
encoded files.
For other files it is possible to base the CREATOR and TYPE on the
filename's extension using a
.I mapping
file (the
.B \-map
option) and/or using the
.I magic number
(usually a
.I signature
in the first few bytes)
of a file (the
.B \-magic
option). If both these options are given, then their order on the command
line is important. If the
.B \-map
option is given first, then a filename extension match is attempted
before a magic number match. However, if the
.B \-magic
option is given first, then a magic number match is attempted before a
filename extension match.
.PP
If a mapping or magic file is not used, or no match is found then the default
CREATOR and TYPE for all regular files can be set by using entries in the 
.B \&.m\&kisofsrc
file or using the 
.B \-hfs\-creator
and/or
.B \-hfs\-type
options, otherwise the default CREATOR and TYPE are 'unix' and 'TEXT'.
.PP
The format of the
.I mapping
file is the same
.I afpfile
format as used by
.IR aufs .
This file has five columns for the
.IR extension ,
.I file
.IR translation ,
.IR CREATOR ,

The first column

column defines the type of text translation between the Unix and
Macintosh file it is ignored by
.BR mkisofs ,
but is kept to be compatible with
.BR aufs (1).
Although 
.B mkisofs
does not alter the contents of a file, if a binary file has its TYPE
set as 'TEXT', it
.I may
be read incorrectly on a Macintosh. Therefore a better choice for the
default TYPE may be '????'

The format of the file is described in the
.BR magic (4)
man page. The only difference here is that for each entry in the magic file, the
.I message
for the initial offset
.B must
be 4 characters for the CREATOR followed by 4 characters for the TYPE -
white space is
optional between them. Any other characters on this line are ignored.
Continuation lines (starting with a '>') are also ignored i.e. only the initial
offset lines are used.
.PP
Using the
.B \-magic
option may significantly increase processing time as each file has to opened
and read to find its magic number.
.PP
In summary, for all files, the default CREATOR is 'unix' and the default
TYPE is 'TEXT'.  These can be changed by using entries in the 
.I \&.m\&kisofsrc 
file or by using the
.B \-hfs\-creator
and/or
.B \-hfs\-type
options. 
.PP
If the a file is in one of the known Apple/Unix formats (and the format
has been selected), then the CREATOR and TYPE are taken from the values
stored in the Apple/Unix file.
.PP
Other files can have their CREATOR and TYPE set from their file name
extension (the
.B \-map
option), or their magic number (the
.B \-magic
option). If the default match is used in the
.I mapping
file, then these values override the default CREATOR and TYPE.

.SH "HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
Macintosh files have two parts called the
.I Data
and
.I Resource
fork. Either may be empty. Unix (and many other OSs) can only
cope with files having one part (or fork). To add to this, Macintosh files
have a number of attributes associated with them - probably the most
important are the TYPE and CREATOR. Again Unix has no concept of these
types of attributes.
.PP
e.g. a Macintosh file may be a JPEG image where the image is stored in the
Data fork and a desktop thumbnail stored in the Resource fork. It is usually
the information in the data fork that is useful across platforms.
.PP
Therefore to store a Macintosh file on a Unix filesystem, a way has to be
found to cope with the two forks and the extra attributes (which are
referred to as the
.I finder
.IR info ).
Unfortunately, it seems that every software package that stores Macintosh
files on Unix has chosen a completely different storage method.
.PP
The Apple/Unix formats that
.I mkisofs
(partially) supports are:
.IP "CAP AUFS format"
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in subdirectory .resource
with same filename as data fork. Finder info
in .finderinfo subdirectory with same filename.
.IP "AppleDouble/Netatalk"
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a file with
same name prefixed with "%". Finder info also stored in same
"%" file. Netatalk uses the same format, but the resource
fork/finderinfo stored in subdirectory .AppleDouble with same
name as data fork.
.IP AppleSingle
Data structures similar to above, except both forks and finder
info are stored in one file.
.IP "Helios EtherShare"
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork and finder info together in
subdirectory .rsrc with same filename as data fork.
.IP "IPT UShare"
Very similar to the EtherShare format, but the finder info
is stored slightly differently.
.IP MacBinary
Both forks and finder info stored in one file.
.IP "Apple PC Exchange"
Used by Macintoshes to store Apple files on DOS (FAT) disks.
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in subdirectory
resource.frk (or RESOURCE.FRK). Finder info as one record
in file finder.dat (or FINDER.DAT). Separate finder.dat for
each data fork directory.
.IP
Note: 
.I mkisofs
needs to know the native FAT cluster size of the disk that the PC Exchange
files are on (or have been copied from). This size is given by the
.B \-cluster\-size
option.
The cluster or allocation size can be found by using the DOS utility
.BR CHKDSK .
.IP
May not work with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files (available with MacOS 8.1).
DOS media containing PC Exchange files should be mounted as type
.B msdos
(not
.BR vfat )
when using Linux.
.IP "SGI/XINET"
Used by SGI machines when they mount HFS disks. Data fork stored
in a file. Resource fork in subdirectory .HSResource with same
name. Finder info as one record in file .HSancillary. Separate .HSancillary
for each data fork directory.
.IP "Thursby Software Systems DAVE"
Allows Macintoshes to store Apple files on SMB servers.
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork in subdirectory
resource.frk. Uses the AppleDouble format to store resource fork.
.IP "Services for Macintosh"
Format of files stored by NT Servers on NTFS filesystems. Data fork is
stored as "filename". Resource fork stored as a NTFS
.I stream
called "filename:AFP_Resource". The finder info is stored as a NTFS
.I stream
called "filename:Afp_AfpInfo". These streams are normally invisible to the
user.
.IP
Warning: mkisofs only partially supports the SFM format. If an HFS file
or folder stored on the NT server contains an
.I illegal
NT character in its name, then NT converts these characters to
.I Private Use Unicode
characters. The characters are: " * / < > ? \ | also a space or
period if it is the last character of the file name, character codes 0x01
to 0x1f (control characters) and Apple' apple logo.
.IP
Unfortunately, these private Unicode characters are not
readable by the mkisofs NT executable. Therefore any file or directory
name containing these characters will be ignored - including the contents of
any such directory.
.IP "MacOS X AppleDouble"
When HFS/HFS+ files are copied or saved by MacOS X on to a non-HFS file
system (e.g. UFS, NFS etc.), the files are stored in AppleDouble format.
Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a file with
same name prefixed with "._". Finder info also stored in same "._" file.
.IP "MacOS X HFS (Alpha)"
Not really an Apple/Unix encoding, but actual HFS/HFS+ files on a MacOS X
system. Data fork stored in a file. Resource fork stored in a pseudo file
with the same name with the suffix '/rsrc'. The finderinfo is only
available via a MacOS X library call.
.IP
Notes: (also see README.macosx)
.IP
Only works when used on MacOS X.
.IP
If a file is found with a zero
length resource fork and empty finderinfo, it is assumed not to have
any Apple/Unix encoding - therefore a TYPE and CREATOR can be set using
other methods.
.LP
.I mkisofs
will attempt to set the CREATOR, TYPE, date and possibly other flags from
the finder info. Additionally, if it exists, the Macintosh filename is set
from the finder info, otherwise the Macintosh name is based on the Unix
filename - see the
.B "HFS MACINTOSH FILE NAMES
section below.
.PP
When using the
.B \-apple
option, the TYPE and CREATOR are stored in the optional System Use or SUSP field
in the ISO-9660 Directory Record - in much the same way as the Rock Ridge
attributes are. In fact to make life easy, the Apple extensions are added
at the beginning of the existing Rock Ridge attributes (i.e. to get the Apple
extensions you get the Rock Ridge extensions as well).
.PP
The Apple extensions require the resource fork to be stored as an ISO-9660
.I associated
file. This is just like any normal file stored in the ISO-9660 filesystem
except that the associated file flag is set in the Directory Record (bit
2). This file has the same name as the data fork (the file seen by
non-Apple machines). Associated files are normally ignored by other OSs
.PP
When using the
.B \-hfs
option, the TYPE and CREATOR plus other finder info, are stored in a separate
HFS directory, not visible on the ISO-9660 volume. The HFS directory references
the same data and resource fork files described above.
.PP
In most cases, it is better to use the
.B \-hfs
option instead of the
.B \-apple
option, as the latter imposes the limited ISO-9660 characters allowed in
filenames. However, the Apple extensions do give the advantage that the
files are packed on the disk more efficiently and it may be possible to fit 
more files on a CD - important when the total size of the source files is
approaching 650MB.

.SH "HFS MACINTOSH FILE NAMES
Where possible, the HFS filename that is stored with an Apple/Unix file
is used for the HFS part of the CD. However, not all the Apple/Unix
encodings store the HFS filename with the finderinfo. In these cases,
the Unix filename is used - with escaped special characters. Special
characters include '/' and characters with codes over 127.
.PP
Aufs escapes these characters by using ":" followed by the character code
as two hex digits. Netatalk and EtherShare have a similar scheme, but uses
"%" instead of a ":".
.PP
If mkisofs can't find an HFS filename, then it uses the Unix name, with
any %xx or :xx characters (xx == two hex digits) converted to a single
character code. If "xx" are not hex digits ([0-9a-fA-F]), then they are
left alone - although any remaining ":" is converted to "%" as colon
is the HFS directory separator. Care must be taken, as an ordinary Unix
file with %xx or :xx will also be converted. e.g.
.PP
.TS
l l 
l s
l l
l s
l l .
This:2fFile	converted to This/File
	
This:File	converted to This%File
	
This:t7File	converted to This%t7File
.TE
.PP
Although HFS filenames appear to support upper and lower case letters,
the filesystem is case insensitive. i.e. the filenames "aBc" and "AbC"
are the same. If a file is found in a directory with the same HFS name,
then
.I mkisofs
will attempt, where possible, to make a unique name by adding '_' characters
to one of the filenames. 
.PP
If an HFS filename exists for a file, then mkisofs can use this name as
the starting point for the ISO-9660, Joliet and Rock Ridge filenames using
the
.B \-mac\-name
option. Normal Unix files without an HFS name will still use their Unix name.
e.g.
.PP
If a
.I MacBinary
(or
.I PC
.IR Exchange )
file is stored as 
.I someimage.gif.bin
on the Unix filesystem, but contains a HFS file called
.IR someimage.gif ,
then this is the name that would appear on the HFS part of the CD. However, as
mkisofs uses the Unix name as the starting point for the other names, then
the ISO-9660 name generated will probably be 
.I SOMEIMAG.BIN
and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be
.IR someimage.gif.bin .
Although the actual data (in this case) is a GIF image. This option will use
the HFS filename as the starting point and the ISO-9660 name will probably be
.I SOMEIMAG.GIF
and the Joliet/Rock Ridge would be
.IR someimage.gif .
.PP
Using the
.B \-mac\-name
option will not currently work with the
.B \-T
option - the Unix
name will be used in the TRANS.TBL file, not the Macintosh name.
.PP
The character set used to convert any HFS file name to a Joliet/Rock Ridge
file name defaults to
.I cp10000
(Mac Roman).
The character set used can be specified using the
.I \-input\-hfs\-charset
option. Other built in HFS character sets are: cp10006 (MacGreek),
cp10007 (MacCyrillic), cp10029 (MacLatin2), cp10079 (MacIcelandandic) and
cp10081 (MacTurkish).
.PP
Note: the character codes used by HFS file names taken from the various
Apple/Unix formats will not be converted as they are assumed to be in the
correct Apple character set. Only the Joliet/Rock Ridge names derived from
the HFS file names will be converted.
.PP
The existing mkisofs code will filter out any illegal characters for the
ISO-9660 and Joliet filenames, but as mkisofs expects to be dealing
directly with Unix names, it leaves the Rock Ridge names as is.
But as '/' is a legal HFS filename character, the
.B \-mac\-name
option converts '/' to a '_' in Rock Ridge filenames.
.PP
If the Apple extensions are used, then only the ISO-9660 filenames will
appear on the Macintosh. However, as the Macintosh ISO-9660 drivers can use
.I Level 2
filenames, then you can use options like
.B \-allow\-multidot
without problems on
a Macintosh - still take care over the names, for example
.I this.file.name
will be converted to
.I THIS.FILE
i.e. only have one '.', also filename
.I abcdefgh
will be seen as
.I ABCDEFGH
but
.I abcdefghi
will be seen as
.I ABCDEFGHI.
i.e. with a '.' at the end - don't know if this is a Macintosh
problem or m\&kisofs/mkhybrid problem. All filenames will be in upper case
when viewed on a Macintosh. Of course, DOS/Win3.X machines will not be able
to see Level 2 filenames...

.SH "HFS CUSTOM VOLUME/FOLDER ICONS
To give a HFS CD a custom icon, make sure the root (top level) folder includes
a standard Macintosh volume icon file. To give a volume a custom icon on
a Macintosh, an icon has to be pasted over the volume's icon in the "Get Info"
box of the volume. This creates an invisible file called 'Icon\\r' ('\\r' is
the 'carriage return' character) in the root folder.
.P
A custom folder icon is very similar - an invisible file called 'Icon\\r'
exits in the folder itself.
.P
Probably the easiest way to create a custom icon that mkisofs can use, is to
format a blank HFS floppy disk on a Mac, paste an icon to its "Get Info"
box. If using Linux with the HFS module installed, mount the floppy using
something like:

	mount \-t hfs /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy

The floppy will be mounted as a CAP file system by default. Then run mkisofs
using something like:

	mkisofs \-\-cap \-o output source_dir /mnt/floppy

If you are not using Linux, then you can use the hfsutils to copy the icon
file from the floppy. However, care has to be taken, as the icon file
contains a control character. e.g.

	hmount /dev/fd0
.br
	hdir \-a
.br
	hcopy \-m Icon^V^M icon_dir/icon

Where '^V^M' is control\-V followed by control\-M. Then run 
.B mkisofs
by using something like:

	mkisofs \-\-macbin \-o output source_dir icon_dir
.PP
The procedure for creating/using custom folder icons is very similar - paste
an icon to folder's "Get Info" box and transfer the resulting 'Icon\\r'
file to the relevant directory in the mkisofs source tree.
.PP
You may want to hide the icon files from the ISO-9660 and Joliet trees.
.PP
To give a custom icon to a Joliet CD, follow the instructions found at:
http://www.fadden.com/cdrfaq/faq03.html#[3-21]

.SH "HFS BOOT DRIVER
It 
.I may
be possible to make the hybrid CD bootable on a Macintosh.
.PP
A bootable HFS CD requires an Apple CD-ROM (or compatible) driver, a bootable
HFS partition and the necessary System, Finder, etc. files.
.PP
A driver can be obtained from any other Macintosh bootable CD-ROM using the
.I apple_driver
utility. This file can then be used with the
.B \-boot\-hfs\-file
option.
.PP
The HFS partition (i.e. the hybrid disk in our case) must contain a
suitable System Folder, again from another CD-ROM or disk.
.PP
For a partition to be bootable, it must have its 
.I boot block
set. The boot
block is in the first two blocks of a partition. For a non-bootable partition
the boot block is full of zeros. Normally, when a System file is copied to
partition on a Macintosh disk, the boot block is filled with a number of
required settings - unfortunately I don't know the full spec for the boot
block, so I'm guessing that the following will work OK.
.PP
Therefore, the utility
.I apple_driver
also extracts the boot block from the
first HFS partition it finds on the given CD-ROM and this is used for the
HFS partition created by
.BR mkisofs .
.IP "PLEASE NOTE"
By using a driver from an Apple CD and copying Apple software to your CD,
you become liable to obey Apple Computer, Inc. Software License Agreements.
.SH "EL TORITO BOOT INFORMATION TABLE
When the
.B \-boot\-info\-table
option is given,
.B mkisofs
will modify the boot file specified by the
.B \-b
option by inserting a 56-byte "boot information table" at offset 8 in
the file.  This modification is done in the source filesystem, so make
sure you use a copy if this file is not easily recreated!  This file
contains pointers which may not be easily or reliably obtained at boot
time.
.PP
The format of this table is as follows; all integers are in
section 7.3.1 ("little endian") format.

i.e. the file README.hfs will be seen as README on the HFS CD and the
other two README files will be hidden. Similarly for the Joliet and
ISO-9660/RockRidge CD.
.PP
There are probably all sorts of strange results possible with
combinations of the hide options ...

.SH NOTES
.PP
.B Mkisofs
may safely be installed suid root. This may be needed to allow
.B mkisofs
to read the previous session when creating a multi session image.
.PP
.B m\&kisofs
is not based on the standard mk*fs tools for unix, because we must generate
a complete copy of an existing filesystem on a disk in the  ISO-9660
filesystem.  The name m\&kisofs is probably a bit of a misnomer, since it
not only creates the filesystem, but it also populates it as well.
However, the appropriate tool name for a UNIX tool that creates populated
filesystems - 
.B mkproto
- is not well known.
.PP
If 
.B mkisofs 
is creating a filesystem image with Rock Ridge attributes and the
directory nesting level of the source directory tree is too much
for ISO-9660, 
.B mkisofs 
will do deep directory relocation.
This results in a directory called
.B RR_MOVED
in the root directory of the CD. You cannot avoid this directory in the 
directory tree that is visible with ISO-9660 but it it automatically hidden
in the
.B Rock Ridge
tree.
.PP
The sparc boot support that is implemented with the
.B \-sparc\-boot
options completely follows the official Sparc CD boot requirements from
the Boot prom in Sun Sparc systems. Some Linux distributions for Sparc
systems use a boot loader called
.B SILO
that unfortunately is not Sparc CD boot compliant.
It is annoyingly to see that the Authors of SILO don't fix SILO but instead
provide a completely unneeded "patch" to mkisofs that incorporates far
more source than the fix for SILO would need.
.SH BUGS
.TP
\(bu
Does not properly read relocated directories in multi-session
mode when adding data.
.sp
Any relocated deep directory is lost if the new session does not
include the deep directory.
.sp
Repeat by: create first session with deep directory relocation
then add new session with a single dir that differs from the
old deep path.
.TP
\(bu
Does not re-use RR_MOVED when doing multi-session from TRANS.TBL
.PP
There may be some other ones.  Please, report them to the author.

.SH "HFS PROBLEMS/LIMITATIONS
I have had to make several assumptions on how I expect the modified
libhfs routines to work, however there may be situations that either
I haven't thought of, or come across when these assumptions fail.
Therefore I can't guarantee that mkisofs will work as expected
(although I haven't had a major problem yet). Most of the HFS features work
fine, however, some are not fully tested. These are marked as
.I Alpha
above.
.PP
Although HFS filenames appear to support upper and lower case letters,
the filesystem is case insensitive. i.e. the filenames "aBc" and "AbC"
are the same. If a file is found in a directory with the same HFS name, then
.I mkisofs
will attempt, where possible, to make a unique name by adding '_' characters
to one of the filenames.
.PP
HFS file/directory names that share the first 31 characters have
_N' (N == decimal number) substituted for the last few characters
to generate unique names.
.PP
Care must be taken when "grafting" Apple/Unix files or directories (see
above for the method and syntax involved). It is not possible to use a
new name for an Apple/Unix encoded file/directory. e.g. If a Apple/Unix
encoded file called "oldname" is to added to the CD, then you can not use
the command line:
.IP
mkisofs \-o output.raw \-hfs \-graft\-points newname=oldname cd_dir
.LP
mkisofs will be unable to decode "oldname". However, you can graft
Apple/Unix encoded files or directories as long as you do not attempt to
give them new names as above.
.PP
When creating an HFS volume with the multisession options,
.B \-M
and
.BR \-C ,
only files in the last session will be in the HFS volume. i.e. mkisofs can
not
.I add
existing files from previous sessions to the HFS volume.
.PP
However, if each session is created with the
.B \-part
option, then each session will appear as 
separate volumes when mounted on a Mac. In this case, it is worth using the 
.B \-V
or
.B \-hfs\-volid
option to give each session a unique volume name,
otherwise each "volume" will appear on the Desktop with the same name.
.PP
Symbolic links (as with all other non-regular files) are not added to
the HFS directory.
.PP
Hybrid volumes may be larger than pure ISO-9660 volumes
containing the same data. In some cases (e.g. DVD sized volumes) the hybrid
volume may be significantly larger. As an HFS volume gets bigger, so does the
allocation block size (the smallest amount of space a file can occupy).
For a 650Mb CD, the allocation block is 10Kb, for a 4.7Gb DVD it will be
about 70Kb.
.PP
The maximum number of files in an HFS volume is about 65500 - although
the real limit will be somewhat less than this.
.PP
The resulting hybrid volume can be accessed on a Unix machine by using
the hfsutils routines. However, no changes can be made to the volume as it
is set as
.B locked.
The option
.B \-hfs\-unlock
will create an output image that is unlocked - however no changes should be
made to the contents of the volume (unless you really know what you are
doing) as it's not a "real" HFS volume.
.PP
Using the
.B \-mac\-name
option will not currently work with the
.B \-T
option - the Unix
name will be used in the TRANS.TBL file, not the Macintosh name.
.PP
Although 
.B mkisofs
does not alter the contents of a file, if a binary file has its TYPE
set as 'TEXT', it
.I may
be read incorrectly on a Macintosh. Therefore a better choice for the
default TYPE may be '????'
.PP
The
.B \-mac\-boot\-file
option may not work at all...
.PP
May not work with PC Exchange v2.2 or higher files (available with MacOS 8.1).
DOS media containing PC Exchange files should be mounted as type
.B msdos
(not
.BR vfat )
when using Linux.
.PP
The SFM format is only partially supported - see
.B HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS
section above.
.PP
It is not possible to use the the
.B \-sparc\-boot
or
.B \-generic\-boot
options with the 
.B \-boot\-hfs\-file
the
.B \-prep\-boot
or
.B \-chrp\-boot
options.
.PP
.B mkisofs
should be able to create HFS hybrid images over 4Gb, although this has not
been fully tested.

.SH "INTERFACE STABILITY
The interfaces provided by 
.B mkisofs
are designed for long term stability.
As
.B mkisofs
depends on interfaces provided by the underlying operating system,
the stability of the interfaces offered by
.B mkisofs
depends on the interface stability of the OS interfaces. 
Modified interfaces in the OS may enforce modified interfaces
in 
.BR mkisofs .
