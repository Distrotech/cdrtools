	1) Finish multiple paths.  Update nlink count on directories if it is
	different than what stat returned.  Save the nlink count that we store in
	the rock ridge attributes so know when we don't have to adjust it.

Well, it was rather hard to get it wrong... But the answer is "yes" if
you have to hear this very word.

And while we're discussing this code. A *cosmetic* *suggestion*.
Consider modifying two lines above the "if(is_directory)" as following:

        set32(&fe->uid,0);
        set32(&fe->gid,0);

or to any other small number. Problem is that with -1 as now 'ls -l'
results in wider output which is rather annoying (it has to print
4294967295 twice while it formats for 8 chars).

Cheers. A.

Extent # auch als off_t statt int

Wenn HFS, dann max File size == 2 GB?
