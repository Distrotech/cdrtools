.TH CDDA2WAV 1 "Version 3.0"
.SH NAME
cdda2wav \- dumps CD audio data into sound files with extra data verification
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cdda2wav
[ 
.I options
][
.BI dev= device
]
.RI [ file(s)
or
.IR directories ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cdda2wav
can retrieve audio tracks from CDROM drives that are
capable of reading audio data digitally to the host via SCSI
.RB ( CDDA ).
.LP
As
.B cdda2wav
implements strategies to work around typical defects on audio CDs it reads many disks that
cannot be read by other software.
As 
.B cdda2wav
may be told to use
.B libparanoia
(see
.B \-paranoia
option below)
to verify the data that has been read from the medium, it delivers superior quality even
if the medium is dusty, scratched or if other problems occur.
.LP
As
.B cdda2wav
may be directed to write the audio data to stdout, it writes all it's informational output
to stderr by default. See
.BI out\-fd= descriptor
option below.
.PP
.SS "Default settings
.PP
.B Cdda2wav
defaults to reead the first audio track from the medium and the default verbose level is set to
.BR "\-vtoc,summary,sectors,titles"
and
.B cdda2wav
by default writes
.B "*.inf
files.
To extract all audio tracks with quality verification, it is recommended to call:
.PP
.B "cdda2wav -vall cddb=0 -paranoia -B"
.SS "Device naming"
Most users do not need to care about device naming at all.
If no
.B dev=
option was specified, 
.B cdda2wav
implements 
.B auto target
support and automagically finds the drive in case that exactly
one CD-ROM type drive is available in the system.
In case that more than one CD-ROM type drive exists on the system,
a list of possible device name parameters may be retrieved with
.B "cdda2wav \-scanbus
or from the target example from the output of
.BR "cdda2wav dev=help" ,
then the
.B dev=
parameter may be set based on the device listing.
.PP
The
.I device
parameter to the
.B dev=
option
explained below refers to
.IR scsibus / target / lun
of the CD/DVD/BluRay-Recorder.
If a file /etc/default/cdrecord exists, the parameter to the
.B dev=
option may also be a drive name label in said file (see FILES section).

.SH OPTIONS
.SS "Informative options"
.TP
.B \-h
.TP
.B \-help
display version information for cdda2wav on standard output.

.SS "Audio options"
.TP
.BI \-a " divider
.TP
.BI \-divider " divider
sets rate to 44100Hz / 
.IR divider . 
Possible values are listed with the
.B \-R
option.
.sp
The default divider value is 1.
.TP
.B \-B
.TP
.B \-bulk
.TP
.B \-alltracks
copies each track into a separate file.
.sp
The default is not to extract all tracks.
.TP
.BI \-b " bits
.TP
.BI \-bits\-per\-sample " bits
sets 
.I bits
per sample per channel:
.BR 8 ,
.B 12
or
.BR 16 .
.sp
The default is 16 bits per sample.
.TP
.BI \-c " channels
.TP
.BI \-channels " channels
use:
.RS
.TP
.B 1
for mono recording
.TP
.B 2
for stereo recording
.TP
.B s
for stereo recording with both channels swapped
.PP
The default is to do stereo recording.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-C " endianess
.TP
.BI \-cdrom\-endianess " endianess
sets endianess of the input samples to 'little', 'big', 'machine' or 'guess' to override defaults.
The value 'machine' or 'host' is evaluated as the actual byte order of
the host CPU in the current OS.
.sp
The default is to detect cdrom endianess automatically.
.TP
.B \-cuefile
Create a CDRWIN compatible CUE file.
A CUE file that completely follows the CDRWIN documentation can only be used to
create 1:1 copies if there is a single file with audio data for the whole disk.
The *.inf file format implements more audio CD features than the CDRWIN CUE format
and it allows to create 1:1 copies if there is one audio data file per track.
Use the CUE file format for meta data only if you really need this format.
.sp
To allow
.B cdda2wav
to create CUE files, you must also specify
.B \-t all
to switch
.B cdda2wav
into a mode that creates a single audio data file for the whole CD.
.TP
.B \-T
.TP
.B \-deemphasize
undo the effect of pre-emphasis in the input samples.
.sp
The default is to keep the audio data in the same state as on the medium and to
mark the pre-emphasis state in the
.B "*.inf
files.
.TP
.BI \-L " cddb mode
.TP
.BI \-cddb " cddb mode
does a cddbp album- and track title lookup based on the cddb id.
The parameter cddb mode defines how multiple entries shall be handled.
.TS H
center box;
r | l.
Parameter	Description
_
-1	disable cddb queries. This is the default.
0	interactive mode. The user selects the entry to use.
1	first fit mode. The first entry is taken unconditionally.
.TE
.TP
.BI cddbp\-server= servername
sets the server to be contacted for title lookups.
.TP
.BI cddbp\-port= portnumber
sets the port number to be used for title lookups.
.TP
.BI \-d " duration
.TP
.BI \-duration " duration
sets recording time in seconds or frames.
Frames (sectors) are indicated by a 'f' suffix (like 75f for 75 sectors).
.B 0
sets the time for whole track.
.sp
The default is to extract the whole track.
.TP
.BI \-E " endianess
.TP
.BI \-output\-endianess " endianess
sets endianess of the output samples to 'little', 'big' or 'machine' to 
override the default which is 'network byte order' (big endian).
The value 'machine' or 'host' is evaluated as the actual byte order of
the host CPU in the current OS.
.TP
.B \-F
.TP
.B \-find\-extremes
finds extreme amplitudes in samples.
.TP
.B \-G
.TP
.B \-find\-mono
finds if input samples are in mono.

.B \-g
.TP
.B \-gui
formats the output to be better parsable by gui frontends.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B \-H
.TP
.B \-no\-infofile
does not write an info file, a cddb file and no cdtext file.
.TP
.BI \-i " index
.TP
.BI \-index " index
selects the start index.
.TP
.B \-J
.TP
.B \-info\-only
does not write to a file, it just gives information about the disc.
.TP
.B \-M 
.TP
.B \-md5
enables calculation of MD-5 checksum for all audio bytes from the beginning 
of a track. The audio header is skipped when calculating the MD-5 checksum
to allow to compare MD-5 sums even for files with different header type.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B \-m
.TP
.B \-mono
sets to mono recording.
.TP
.B \-no\-hidden\-track
Ignore hidden tracks on the CD.
By default,
.B cdda2wav
checks whether there might be a hidden track before track 1.
This check may take a few seconds and thus can be disabled with
.BR \-no\-hidden\-track .
.TP
.B \-N
.TP
.B \-no\-write
does not write to a file, it just reads (e.g. for debugging purposes).
If this option is used together with the
.B \-e
option, the CD is read and the audio content is played back to the sound device
without creating output files with audio data.
.TP
.B \-no\-textdefaults
By default,
.B cdda2wav
replaces empty CD-Text fields from tracks by the related CD-Text fiel for the
whole CD in case this is defined. If the option
.B \-no\-textdefaults
is used,
.B cdda2wav
leaves the track related CD-Text fields empty in such a case.
.TP
.B \-no\-textfile
If
.B cdda2wav
encounters useful CD-Text information on the CD, it writes a .cdtext file.
The option
.B \-no\-textfile
allows to suppress the creation of the .cdtext file.
.TP
.BI \-o " offset
.TP
.BI \-offset " offset
starts
.I offset
sectors behind start track (one sector equivalents 1/75 seconds).
.TP
.BI \-O " audiotype
.TP
.BI \-output\-format " audiotype
can be 
.I wav
(for wav files) or
.I aiff
(for apple/sgi aiff files) or
.I aifc
(for apple/sgi aifc files) or
.I au
or
.I sun
(for sun .au PCM files) or
.I cdr
or
.I raw
(for headerless files to be used for cd writers).
.sp
The default output format is now
.B wav
for all platforms as this file format has become the most
common format. Note that former versions of
.B cdda2wav 
made an exception and by default did create
.B au
type files on Solaris.
.TP
.BI \-p " percentage
.TP
.BI \-playback\-realtime " percentage
changes pitch of audio data copied to sound device.
.TP
.BI \-P " sectors
.TP
.BI  \-set\-overlap " sectors
sets the initial number of overlap
.I sectors
for jitter correction in non-paranoia mode. Note that overlapped reads re handled
differently in paranoia mode.
.sp
The default overlap in non-paranoia mode is 1.
.TP
.B \-paranoia
use the paranoia library as a filter on top of cdda2wav's routines for reading.
In
.B paranoia
mode, the latency time 
for the  
.B \-interactive 
mode is increased to typically 5..10 seconds. This is caused by the fact that the
.B paranoia
code reads anything at least twice and in between needs to take care of emptying the
cache RAM of the CD-ROM drive.
.sp

.BI dev= device
.TP

.TP
.BI \-device " device
uses
.I device
as the source for CDDA reading.
For example /dev/cdrom for the
.B cooked_ioctl
interface and Bus,ID,Lun for the 
.B generic_scsi
interface. The
.I device
has to correspond with the interface setting if given (see 
.BR \-I " and " \-interface
option below).
.sp
If no 
.BR \-I " or " \-interface
option has been specified, the interface setting is derived from
the device name syntax. A device name that is in the form
Bus,ID,Lun or contains a colon (':') defaults to the
.B generic_scsi
interface.
.sp
Using the
.B cooked_ioctl
is not recommended as this makes
.B cdda2wav
mainly depend on the audio extraction quality of the operating system
which is usually extremely bad. For this reason, avoid using parameters like
.BR dev= /dev/cdrom
for the device. 
.sp
The setting of the environment variable
.B CDDA_DEVICE
is overridden by this option.
.sp
If no 
.B dev=
option is present, or if the
.B dev=
option only contains a transport specifyer but no address,
.B cdda2wav 
tries to scan the SCSI address space for CD-ROM drives.
If exactly one is found, this is used by default.

.TP
.B \-scanbus
Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and print the inquiry

CD/DVD-Recorder on a system.
The numbers printed out as labels are computed by: 
.B "bus * 100 + target
.TP
.BI ts= #
Set the maximum transfer size for a single SCSI command to #.
The syntax for the 
.B ts=
option is the same as for cdrecord fs=# or sdd bs=#.
.sp
If no 
.B ts=
option has been specified,
.B cdda2wav
defaults to a transfer size of 3\ MB. If libscg gets lower values from the
operating system, the value is reduced to the maximum value that is possible
with the current operating system.
Sometimes, it may help to further reduce the transfer size or to enhance it,
but note that it may take a long time to find a better value by experimenting
with the
.B ts=
option.
.sp
Some operating systems return wrong values for the maximum transfer size.
If the transfer totally hangs or resets occur, it may be appropriate to reduce
the transfer size to less than 64 kB or even less than 32 kB.

Note that this forces 
.B cdda2wav
to create a pipe to the 
.B rsh(1)
program and disallows
.B cdda2wav
to directly access the network socket to the remote server.
This makes it impossible to set up performance parameters and slows down
the connection compared to a

.SH "DISCUSSION"
.B cdda2wav
is able to read parts of an
.B audio
CD or
.B multimedia
CDROM (containing audio parts) directly digitally. These parts can be
written to a file, a pipe, or to a sound device.
.PP
.B cdda2wav
stands for
.B CDDA
to
.B WAV
(where
.B CDDA
stands for compact disc digital audio and
.B WAV
is a sound sample format introduced by MS Windows).  It
allows copying
.B CDDA
audio data from the CDROM drive into a file in 
.B WAV
or other formats.
.PP
Some versions of
.B cdda2wav
may try to get higher real-time scheduling priorities to ensure
smooth (uninterrupted) operation. These priorities are available for super users
and are higher than those of 'normal' processes. Thus delays are minimized.
.PP
If you only have one CDROM
and it is loaded with an audio CD, you may simply invoke
.B cdda2wav
and it will create the sound file
.B audio.wav
recording the whole track beginning with track 1 in stereo at 16 bit at 44100
Hz sample rate, if your file system has enough space free.  Otherwise
recording time will be limited. For details see files
.B README
and
.BR README.INSTALL .
.PP
If you have more then one CD-ROM type drive in the system, you need
to specify the 
.B dev=
option.
.SH "HINTS ON OPTIONS"
.PP
Most of the options are used to control the format of the WAV file. In
the following text most of them are discussed in a more verbose way.
.SS "Select Device"
.BI dev= "device"
selects the CDROM drive device to be used.
The specifier given should correspond to the selected interface (see below).
For the 
.B cooked_ioctl
interface this is the cdrom device descriptor.
.B "The SCSI devices used with the generic SCSI interface however are
.B "addressed with their SCSI-Bus, SCSI-Id, and SCSI-Lun instead of the generic
.B "SCSI device descriptor.
One example for a SCSI CDROM drive on bus 0 with SCSI ID 3 and lun 0 is 
.BR dev=0,3,0 .
.SS "Select Auxiliary device"
.BI \-A " auxdevice"
may be needed in some rare cases for CD-Extra handling.
.B Cdda2wav
usually has no problem to get the multi-session information for
CD-Extra using raw SCSI commands.
For Non-SCSI-CDROM drives this is the
same device as given by 
.B dev=
(see above). For SCSI-CDROM drives it is the
CDROM drive (SCSI) device (i.e.  
.B /dev/sr0
) corresponding to the SCSI device (i.e.
.B 0,3,0
). It has to match the device used for sampling.
.SS "Select Interface"
.BI \-I " interface"
selects the CDROM drive communication method. 
This interface method is typically automatically selected from the device name.
For SCSI drives
.B generic_scsi
is used (cooked_ioctl may not be available for all devices).
Valid names are
.B generic_scsi
and
.BR cooked_ioctl .
The first uses the generic SCSI interface, the latter uses the ioctl of
the CDROM driver. The latter variant works only when the kernel driver supports
.B CDDA
reading. This entry has to match the selected CDROM device (see above).
.SS "Enable echo to soundcard"
.B \-e
copies audio data to the sound card while recording, so you hear it nearly
simultaneously. The soundcard gets the same data that is recorded. This
is time critical, so it works best with the
.B \-q
option.  To use
.B cdda2wav
as a pseudo CD player without recording in a file you could use
.PP
.B "cdda2wav \-q \-e \-t2 \-d0 \-N"
.PP
to play the whole second track or
.PP
.B "cdda2wav \-q \-e \-B \-N"
.PP
to play the whole disk.
This feature reduces the recording speed
to at most onefold speed.
.SS "Change pitch of echoed audio"
.B "\-p percentage"
changes the pitch of all audio echoed to a sound card. Only the copy
to the soundcard is affected, the recorded audio samples in a file
remain the same.
Normal pitch, which is the default, is given by 100%.
Lower percentages correspond to lower pitches, i.e.
\-p 50 transposes the audio output one octave lower.
See also the script
.B pitchplay
as an example. This option was contributed by Raul Sobon.
.SS "Select mono or stereo recording"
.B \-m
or
.B "\-c 1"
selects mono recording (both stereo channels are mixed),
.B \-s
or
.B "\-c 2"
or
.B "\-c s"
selects stereo recording. Parameter s
will swap both sound channels.
.SS "Select maximum quality"
.B \-x
will set stereo, 16 bits per sample at 44.1 KHz (full CD quality).  Note
that other format options given later can change this setting.
.SS "Select sample quality"
.B "\-b 8"
specifies 8 bit (1 Byte) for each sample in each channel;
.B "\-b 12"
specifies 12 bit (2 Byte) for each sample in each channel;
.B "\-b 16"
specifies 16 bit (2 Byte) for each sample in each channel (Ensure that
your sample player or sound card is capable of playing 12-bit or 16-bit
samples). Selecting 12 or 16 bits doubles file size.  12-bit samples are
aligned to 16-bit samples, so they waste some disk space.
.SS "Select sample rate"
.BI \-r " samplerate"
selects a sample rate.
.I samplerate
can be in a range between 44100 and 900. Option
.B \-R
lists all available rates.
.SS "Select sample rate divider"
.BI \-a " divider"
selects a sample rate divider.
.I divider
can be minimally 1 and maximally 50.5 and everything between in steps of 0.5.
Option
.B \-R
lists all available rates.
.sp
To make the sound smoother at lower sampling rates,
.B cdda2wav
sums over
.I n
samples (where
.I n
is the specific dividend). So for 22050 Hertz output we have to sum over
2 samples, for 900 Hertz we have to sum over 49 samples.  This cancels
higher frequencies. Standard sector size of an audio CD (ignoring
additional information) is 2352 Bytes. In order to finish summing
for an output sample at sector boundaries the rates above have to be
chosen.  Arbitrary sampling rates in high quality would require some
interpolation scheme, which needs much more sophisticated programming.
.SS "List a table of all sampling rates"
.BI \-R
shows a list of all sample rates and their dividers. Dividers can range
from 1 to 50.5 in steps of 0.5.
.SS "Select start track and optionally end track"
.BI \-t " n+m"
selects
.B n
as the start track and optionally
.B m
as the last track of a range to be recorded.
These tracks must be from the table of contents.  This sets
the track where recording begins. Recording can advance through the
following tracks as well (limited by the optional end track or otherwise
depending on recording time). Whether one file or different files are
then created depends on the
.B \-B
option (see below).
.SS "Select start index"
.BI \-i " n"
selects the index to start recording with.  Indices other than 1 will
invoke the index scanner, which will take some time to find the correct
start position. An offset may be given additionally (see below).
.SS "Set recording duration"
.B \-d " n"
sets recording time to
.I n
seconds or set recording time for whole track if
.I n
is zero. In order to specify the duration in frames (sectors) also, the
argument can have an appended 'f'. Then the numerical argument is to be
taken as frames (sectors) rather than seconds.
Please note that if track ranges are being used they define the recording
time as well thus overriding any
.BR \-d " option"
specified times.
.sp
Recording time is defined as the time the generated sample will play (at
the defined sample rate). Since it's related to the amount of generated
samples, it's not the time of the sampling process itself (which can be
less or more).  It's neither strictly coupled with the time information on
the audio CD (shown by your hifi CD player).
Differences can occur by the usage of the
.B \-o
option (see below). Notice that recording time will be shortened, unless
enough disk space exists. Recording can be aborted at anytime by
pressing the break character (signal SIGQUIT).
.SS "Record all tracks of a complete audio CD in separate files"
.B \-B
copies each track into a separate file. A base name can be given. File names
have an appended track number and an extension corresponding to the audio
format. To record all audio tracks of a CD, use a sufficient high duration
(i.e. \-d99999).
.SS "Set start sector offset"
.BI \-o " sectors"
increments start sector of the track by
.IR sectors .
By this option you are able to skip a certain amount at the beginning of
a track so you can pick exactly the part you want. Each sector runs for 1/75
seconds, so you have very fine control. If your offset is so high that
it would not fit into the current track, a warning message is issued
and the offset is ignored.  Recording time is not reduced.  (To skip
introductory quiet passages automagically, use the
.B \-w
option see below.)
.SS "Wait for signal option"
.B \-w
Turning on this option will suppress all silent output at startup,
reducing possibly file size.
.B cdda2wav
will watch for any signal in the output signal and switches on writing
to file.
.SS "Find extreme samples"
.B \-F
Turning on this option will display the most negative and the most positive
sample value found during recording for both channels. This can be useful
for readjusting the volume. The values shown are not reset at track
boundaries, they cover the complete sampling process. They are taken from
the original samples and have the same format (i.e. they are independent
of the selected output format).
.SS "Find if input samples are in mono"
.B \-G
If this option is given, input samples for both channels will be compared. At
the end of the program the result is printed. Differences in the channels
indicate stereo, otherwise when both channels are equal it will indicate mono.
.SS "Undo the pre-emphasis in the input samples"
.B \-T
Some older audio CDs are recorded with a modified frequency response called
pre-emphasis. This is found mostly in classical recordings. The correction
can be seen in the flags of the Table Of Contents often. But there are
recordings, that show this setting only in the subchannels. If this option
is given, the index scanner will be started, which reads the q-subchannel
of each track. If pre-emphasis is indicated in the q-subchannel of a track,
but not in the TOC, pre-emphasis will be assumed to be present, and
subsequently a reverse filtering is done for this track before the samples
are written into the audio file.
.SS "Set audio format"
.B \-O " audiotype"
can be 
.I wav
(for wav files) or
.I au
or
.I sun
(for sun PCM files) or
.I cdr
or
.I raw
(for headerless files to be used for cd writers).
All file samples are coded in linear pulse code modulation (as done
in the audio compact disc format). This holds for all audio formats.
Wav files are compatible to Wind*ws sound files, they have lsb,msb byte order
which is the opposite byte order to the one used on the audio cd. 
The default filename extension is '.wav'.
Sun type files are not like the older common logarithmically coded .au files,
but instead as mentioned above linear PCM is used. The byte order is msb,lsb
to be compatible. The default filename extension is '.au'.
The AIFF and the newer variant AIFC from the Apple/SGI world store their samples
in bigendian format (msb,lsb). In AIFC no compression is used.
Finally the easiest 'format',
the cdr aka raw format. It is done per default in msb,lsb byte order to satisfy
the order wanted by most cd writers. Since there is no header information in this
format, the sample parameters can only be identified by playing the samples
on a soundcard or similar. The default filename extension is '.cdr' or '.raw'.
.SS "Select cdrom drive reading speed"
.B \-S " speed"
allows to switch the cdrom drive to a certain level of speed in order to
reduce read errors. The argument is transferred verbatim to the drive.
Details depend very much on the cdrom drives.
An argument of 0 for example is often the default speed of the drive,
a value of 1 often selects single speed.
.SS "Enable MD5 checksums"
.B \-M " count"
enables calculation of MD-5 checksum for 'count' bytes from the beginning of a
track. This was introduced for quick comparisons of tracks.
.SS "Use Monty's libparanoia for reading of sectors"
.B \-paranoia
selects an alternate way of extracting audio sectors. Monty's library is used
with the following default options:
.sp
PARANOIA_MODE_FULL, but without PARANOIA_MODE_NEVERSKIP
.sp
for details see Monty's libparanoia documentation.
In this case the option
.B \-P
has no effect.
.SS "Do linear or overlapping reading of sectors"
(This applies unless option
.B \-paranoia
is used.)
.B \-P " sectors"
sets the given number of sectors for initial overlap sampling for jitter
correction. Two cases are to be distinguished. For nonzero values,
some sectors are read twice to enable cdda2wav's jitter correction.
If an argument of zero is given, no overlap sampling will be used.
For nonzero overlap sectors cdda2wav dynamically adjusts the setting during
sampling (like cdparanoia does).
If no match can be found, cdda2wav retries the read with an increased overlap.
If the amount of jitter is lower than the current overlapped samples, cdda2wav
reduces the overlap setting, resulting in a higher reading speed.
The argument given has to be lower than the total number of sectors per request
(see option
.I -n
below).
Cdda2wav will check this setting and issues a error message otherwise.
The case of zero sectors is nice on low load situations or errorfree (perfect)
cdrom drives and perfect (not scratched) audio cds.
.SS "Set the transfer size"
.B \-n " sectors"
will set the transfer size to the specified sectors per request.
.SS "Set number of ring buffer elements"
.B \-l " buffers"
will allocate the specified number of ring buffer elements.
.SS "Set endianess of input samples"
.B \-C " endianess"
will override the default settings of the input format.
Endianess can be set explicitly to "little", "big" or "machine" or to the automatic
endianess detection based on voting with "guess".
.SS "Set endianess of output samples"
.B \-E " endianess"
(endianess can be "little", "big" or "machine") will override the
default settings of the output format.
.SS "Verbose option"
.B \-v " itemlist"
prints more information. A list allows selection of different
information items.
.sp
.TP 10
.B help
Print a summary of possible members of the diffopts list.
.TP
.B !
Invert the meaning of the following string. No comma is needed after the 
exclamation mark.
.TP 10
.B not
Invert the meaning of all members in the diffopts list i.e. exclude 
all present options from an initially complete set compare list.
When using 
.BR csh (1)
you might have problems to use 
.B "!"
due to its strange parser.
This is why the 
.B "not"
alias exists.
.TP
.B "disable"
disables verbosity
.TP
.B "all"
all information is given 
.TP
.B "toc"
displays the table of contents
.TP
.B "summary"
displays a summary of recording parameters
.TP
.B "indices"
invokes the index scanner and displays start positions of indices
.TP
.B "catalog"
retrieves and displays a media catalog number
.TP
.B "trackid"
retrieves and displays international standard recording codes
.TP
.B "sectors"
displays track start positions in absolute sector notation
.PP
To combine several requests just list the suboptions separated with commas.
.SS "The table of contents"
The display will show the table of contents with number of tracks and
total time (displayed in
.IR mm : ss . hh
format,
.IR mm =minutes,
.IR ss =seconds,
.IR hh "=rounded 1/100 seconds)."
The following list displays track number and track time for each entry.
The summary gives a line per track describing the type of the track.
.sp
.ce 1
.B "track preemphasis copypermitted tracktype chans"
.sp
The
.B track
column holds the track number.
.B preemphasis
shows if that track has been given a non linear frequency response.
NOTE: You can undo this effect with the
.B \-T
option.
.B "copy\-permitted"
indicates if this track is allowed to copy.
.B "tracktype"
can be data or audio. On multimedia CDs (except hidden track CDs) 
both of them should be present.
.B "channels"
is defined for audio tracks only. There can be two or four channels.
.SS "No file output"
.B \-N
this debugging option switches off writing to a file.
.SS "No infofile generation"
.B \-H
this option switches off creation of an info file and a cddb file.
.SS "Generation of simple output for gui frontends"
.B \-g
this option switches on simple line formatting, which is needed to support
gui frontends (like xcd-roast).
.SS "Verbose SCSI logging"
.B \-V
this option switches on logging of SCSI commands. This will produce
a lot of output (when SCSI devices are being used).
This is needed for debugging purposes. The format
is the same as being used with the cdrecord program, see
.BR cdrecord (1)
for more information.
.SS "Quiet option"
.B \-q
suppresses all screen output except error messages.
That reduces cpu time resources.
.SS "Just show information option"
.B \-J
does not write a file, it only prints information about the disc (depending
on the
.B \-v
option). This is just for information purposes.
.SH "CDDBP support"
.SS "Lookup album and track titles option"
.B \-L " cddbp mode"
Cdda2wav tries to retrieve performer, album-, and track titles from a cddbp
server. The default server right now is 'freedb.freedb.org'.
It is planned to have more control over the server handling later.
The parameter defines how multiple entries are handled:
.IP \fB0\fP
interactive mode, the user chooses one of the entries.
.IP \fB1\fP
take the first entry without asking.
.SS "Set server for title lookups"
.B cddbp\-server " servername"
When using \-L or \-cddb, the server being contacted can be set with
this option.
.SS "Set portnumber for title lookups"
.B cddbp\-port " portnumber"
When using \-L or \-cddb, the server port being contacted can be set with
this option.
.SH "HINTS ON USAGE"
Don't create samples you cannot read. First check your sample player
software and sound card hardware. I experienced problems with very low
sample rates (stereo <= 1575 Hz, mono <= 3675 Hz) when trying to play
them with standard WAV players for sound blaster (maybe they are not
legal in
.B WAV
format). Most CD-Writers insist on audio samples in a bigendian format.
Now cdda2wav supports the 
.B \-E " endianess"
option to control the endianess of the written samples.
.PP
If your hardware is fast enough to run cdda2wav
uninterrupted and your CD drive is one of the 'perfect' ones, you will
gain speed when switching all overlap sampling off with the
.B \-P " 0"
option. Further fine tuning can be done with the
.B \-n " sectors"
option. You can specify how much sectors should be requested in one go.
.PP
Cdda2wav supports
.BR pipes .
Use a filename of
.B \-
to let cdda2wav output its samples to standard output.
.PP
Conversion to other sound formats can be done using the
.B sox
program package (although the use of
.B sox \-x
to change the byte order of samples should be no more necessary; see option
.B \-E
to change the output byteorder).
.PP
If you want to sample more than one track into
different files in one run, this is currently possible with the
.B \-B
option. When recording time exceeds the track limit a new file will
be opened for the next track.
.SH FILES
Cdda2wav can generate a lot of files for various purposes.
.SS "Audio files:
.PP
There are audio files containing samples with default extensions
\&.wav, .au, .aifc, .aiff, and .cdr according to the selected sound format.
These files are not generated when option
.RB ( \-N )
is given. Multiple files may
be written when the bulk copy option
.RB ( \-B )
is used. Individual file names
can be given as arguments. If the number of file names given is sufficient
to cover all included audio tracks, the file names will be used verbatim.
Otherwise, if there are less file names than files needed to write the
included tracks, the part of the file name before the extension is extended
with '_dd' where dd represents the current track number.
.SS "Cddb and Cdindex files:
.PP
If cdda2wav detects cd-extra or cd-text (album/track) title information,
then .cddb, .cdindex and .cdtext files are generated unless suppressed by the
option
.BR \-H .
They contain suitable formatted entries for submission to
audio cd track title databases in the internet. The CDINDEX and CDDB(tm)
systems are currently supported. For more information please visit
www.musicbrainz.org and www.freedb.com.
.SS "Inf files:
.PP
The inf files are describing the sample files and the part from the audio cd,
it was taken from. They are a means to transfer information to a cd burning
program like cdrecord. For example, if the original audio cd had pre-emphasis
enabled, and cdda2wav
.B \-T
did remove the pre-emphasis, then the inf file has
pre-emphasis not set (since the audio file does not have it anymore), while
the .cddb and the .cdindex have pre-emphasis set as the original does.
.SH WARNING
.B IMPORTANT:
it is prohibited to sell copies of copyrighted material by noncopyright
holders. This program may not be used to circumvent copyrights.
The user acknowledges this constraint when using the software.
.SH BUGS
The index scanner may give timeouts.
.sp
The resampling (rate conversion code) uses polynomial interpolation, which
is not optimal.
.sp
Cdda2wav should use threads.
.sp
Cdda2wav currently cannot sample hidden audio tracks that reside in track #1 index 0.
